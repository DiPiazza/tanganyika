  <h1>The Tatoga of Tanganyika</h1>

<h2 id="part-one">PART ONE<a class="headerlink" href="#part-one" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>

<h2 id="i-introduction">I. INTRODUCTION<a class="headerlink" href="#i-introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This paper has been written to provide a peg upon which to hang future papers and publications on the Barabaig and other Tatoga groups in Tanganyika. Here I am giving the barest outline of the ecological distributions of the Tatoga and a brief description of their physical environment, migration complex, and tribal organization. The major emphasis will be on the Barabaig among whom I have lived for nearly two years. The other Tatoga groups were very briefly visited but it is hoped that sometime in the future it will be possible to spend more time with each of these groups. The final section is concerned with Barabaig murders and should prove of interest to readers in Tanganyika.</p>
<p>There is very little published material to be found on the Tatoga apart from several short articles in unavailable German periodicals and a brief article in <em>Tanganyika Notes and Records</em> by C. H.N. Jackson, Ph.D. A comprehensive bibliography of works mentioning the Tatoga of Tanganyika is included at the end of the paper.</p>
<h3 id="origins">Origins.<a class="headerlink" href="#origins" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The language of the Tatoga groups has been classified by Huntingford<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and others as Nilo-Hamitic and of the Nandi type. There is no doubt about the fact that Tatoga were living in the Mount Elgon region some two hundred and fifty years ago, but whether they were Nandi people who had been separated from Nandi for centuries or people of a common generic stock to the Nandi, Kipsigis and Masai, who left the Mount Elgon area in face of the Nandi invasion, I am not prepared to say éxcept that, at the moment, I strongly favour the latter explanation. That they lived on Mount Elgon is proved by a myth which is common to at least three of the sub-tribes to the effect that they inhabited a high mountain from which they could see two large bodies of water (i.e. Lake Victoria and Lake Rudolf). This place was called the land of the rivers and elephants or, in the vernacular, Endabesht. There is a place to be found today called Endabess which was inhabited, say the Nandi, by the Sirikwa. “These people were like the Nandi but not completely Nandi in language and customs and they suddenly disappeared leaving only a small group who became completely assimilated,” goes the story of my Nandi informant, Chief Isaiah Keina, at Kapsabet, Kenya. He and his mother are both des-
cendants of the Sirikwa who remained.</p>
<p>There is no doubt about the numerous words in the two languages, Tatoga and Nandi, which are identical but on the other hand there are many linguistical differences of a structural nature which could hardly have occurred within so short a period. Masculine and feminine nouns
are found, for example, in Nandi but not in Tatoga. The word order, tense structure, and formation of plurals are different. In any case language is a highly suspect criterion of common origin, especially if it is not backed up by cultural and other data.</p>
<p>The age-sets of the Nandi and Kipsigis can be compared easily to those of the Masai whilst those of the Tatoga are so different that to call them age-grades would only confuse the reader. It is better to refer to them as generation names. These named generation groups did have limited functions in time of war but certainly not on the organised scale or efficient system of the Masai and Nandi age-sets. A generation name. of the Tatoga, forms an exogamous horizontal group in that society and this is its chief function. That a generation group of this nature should have evolved in a purely pastoral society is consistent with their form of social organisation
and I hope to make this a thesis for a future monograph on the Barabaig to be published in a journal concerned with anthropological theory.</p>
<p>The circumcision ceremonies are different between the two groups but it is doubted whether they have always been so. Today, or rather in the recent past, the Nandi circumcised on the Masai pattern which demands unflinching courage of the youths. The Barabaig boy, on the other hand, is expected to make as much noise as possible to solicit the aid of the ancestors, male and female, to help him through the ordeal. There is a picture in Hollis’s <em>“Nandi”</em> facing page 52 (plate xxi) of a Nandi boy who had recently been circumcised. This picture could be a Barabaig boy holding the traditional thorn switch during the period of licence and freedom he enjoys after circumcision. These boys are known as <em>mudamujek</em> and the switch is called <em>wapkant</em>. The <em>wapkant</em> is used to demand favours from the young women of the tribe. The Nandi elders questioned, however, professed not to know why the Nandi boy was holding the switch,
or its name, when shown the picture.</p>
<p>One striking similarity was found in the attitude to iron working. The Nandi in the recent past and the Barabaig today rely for iron work on a special clan or sub-tribe, the Gidanwodik.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> The avoidances of the ironmaker’s tools, his person, his house and his daughters are found to be the same in both societies, although these avoidances have been overlooked in recent years by the Nandi. Further, the Gidanwodik marry endogamously whereas all other clans marry exogamously. Perhaps it is best to regard them as a sub-tribe although, unlike other sub-tribes, they have no territorial identification.</p>
<p>Another similarity is the clan of rainmakers, the Ghowu in Nandi, the Ghowok in Barabaig. These two clans, the Gidanwodik and Ghowok, were found in every one of the Tatoga groups which I visited with the exception of the Salagwajek at Salawe who are completely Sukuma-ized. The Daremajek clan, which is the medicine clan, is also found throughout
Tanganyika but was not known in Nandi.</p>
<p>There were many similarities found among the terminology for cattle. In both Nandi and Tatoga the word <em>samoi</em> means a brindle-coloured animal and samoient in Nandi is the plural, <em>samohent</em> is the plural in Barabaig and is also the name of one of the largest clans, meaning, the people who came with brindle cattle.</p>
<p>Politically many terms were found to be the same in Tatoga and Nandi. The names for the recognised leader of a clan council <em>girwach</em> (B) and <em>girwach</em> (N); the name for the council, girgwageit is the same, as is njogot</p>
<figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(B), <em>njogeit</em> (N), the name of the fine imposed by the clan elders on a member. The Nandi today call their chief <em>girgwagir</em>, which means in Barabaig, the speaker in a clan or other council, the Barabaig have borrowed the Sukuma word, <em>mutemi(t)</em> or <em>mtemit</em>.</p>
<p>The words used for the parts of the body both for animals and humans are very closely related. The hump <em>ukta</em> (N) and <em>huck’t</em> (B), of a bullock sacrificed on any special occasion is eaten by the most important elder of the clan in both societies. The name for the part eaten, the centre portion, is <em>gigwengwen</em> (N) and <em>gigwengwesind</em> (B).</p>
<p>There are, however, several words common to both but with significant differences in meaning. One such word is <em>lugeit</em>, which means warriors in Nandi, and <em>lugweig</em>, the enemy, in Barabaig. Another is the term <em>gargweit</em> which in Nandi means an old woman, in Barabaig, a venerable
old man. Kinship terminology is purely descriptive in Tatoga but classificatory in Nandi.</p>
<p>So much for similarities and differences between Tatoga and Nandi. The fact is apparent from linguistic and cultural material that they are of the same basic stock and that they were formerly in contact with each other. This writer hesitates to say more, but it is understood that Mr. G.
W. B. Huntingford will shortly be publishing a monograph on the Nilo-Hamitic groups in Kenya and Tanganyika and it is hoped that he will throw more light on the ancient migrations of these interesting people. It must be made clear, however, that the Barabaig are definitely not Jaluo as stated by Father Crazzolara in his recent work on the Luo.</p>
<h3 id="general-characteristics">General Characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#general-characteristics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>What is to follow on general characteristics, appearance, temperament, nutrition, house types, etc., applies to all of the sub-tribes except those at Salawe, Itigi and Muhalala, where the Tatoga have married Bantu wives for generations. In other areas intermarriage has taken place but not on anything like the same scale.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Barabaig varies greatly as it does among most people; some are tall, some are short, some are thin, some are fat. Their skin colour ranges from black through light brown to bronze. One is struck with a “type,” however, which one usually describes when asked what these people look like. The typical Barabaig is tall, muscular and well developed. I am five feet and eleven inches tall and a goodly number of Barabaig males are taller than I and many women approach my height. There are a few exceptionally tall men measuring six feet and three inches or more and the occasional individual at five feet. Average women, I should estimate, range between five feet and five inches to five feet and seven inches, whereas the average male ranges between five feet and nine inches to five feet and eleven inches.</p>
<p>The Barabaig are a cattle people and consequently the average standard of nutrition is comparatively high. Unlike most Tanganyika peoples, their diet is notably high in animal protein, blood and milk being the chief food supplemented by meat from sheep, goats, cattle and game. This was their sole diet until comparatively recently. Even today a goodly proportion of
the Barbaig do not depend in the least on maize, although they are increasingly developing the taste for it. No medical research, to my knowledge, has ever been carried out among these people. Therefore it is difficult to say accurately whether their standard of health compares favourably or unfavourably with surrounding peoples. Apart from a supposedly high incidence of venereal diseases there have not been any epidemics recently of the more common contagious diseases nor a high incidence of illness. Bubonic plague hit one area in November, 1951, and forty-six people died before it was brought under control. This, however, has little to do with
nutrition.</p>
<p>I have accurate figures of a one hundred percent sample of the Barabaig homesteads in a border area which reveal that the one hundred or more married women living there, had borne over six hundred children between them, of whom over three hundred had died. This high figure of infant mortality is due, I feel, more to habits of personal hygiene than to nutrition. An actual statistically accurate breakdown would certainly reveal more. My sample was one hundred percent and therefore included women just married, in their teens, and others ready for the grave.</p>
<p>It is difficult to discuss habits of dress and personal hygiene from our ethnocentric point of view. The first reaction of most Europeans is that the Barabaig women smell. They do—it is because the animal skins with which they clothe themselves are cured in urine, preferably that from a
pregnant woman. A well-made Barabaig cloak and skirt, however, would be admired by the finest Parisian houses of fashion or by Christian Dior himself—apart from the smell. These garments are also practical, they shed the rain well and they are warm and protect the individual from the high wind which blows at near gale force for several months of the year.
When working, the women strip to the waist, the men simply strip. Unmarried women of all ages do not wear the skirt, only the cloak, but it is unusual to see either males or females of any age stark naked away from their homestead unless, of course, the men are working the wells or cutting trees. The men wear a large sheet of white cotton cloth, <em>hank’t</em>, usually dyed with red.ochre and impregnated with clarified butter. The hank’t, if one is in style, should be capable of completely covering all the anatomy. A well dressed male will wear sixteen yards of thirty-six inch material sewn in such a way to measure four yards by four yards and this is often fringed all around with tassels.</p>
<p>Women of the Buradik, Banjut, Iseimajek and Rutageink on the Wembere and Sibiti do not wear the cloak but have taken to wearing a black light cotton cloth, <em>hank’t</em>. Many of these are studded with designs worked into the cloth with small pieces of brass wire. The men also appear to
prefer black. The women say that in the old days their grandmothers wore the leather cloak but because of the heat in the vast low-lying plain that they now occupy they have discarded it. Married women still wear the traditional gored leather skirt.</p>
<p>Habits of personal hygiene vary greatly among the Barabaig. Some could be grouped among the dirtiest primitive people that I have ever encountered, while others are among the cleanest. I have eaten in some</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>homesteads where warm water was first brought to wash face and hands and in others where I was hardly able to eat because of the filth. Again it is possible to generalize by saying that when water is available most Barabaig wash; when it is not, few go to the trouble to make it available.</p>
<p>The sanitary habits of the natives are primitive but not as injurious to nealth as among primary agriculturalists who keep animal and human manures tor their farms. Young children learn at an early age that, by their own standard, one should not be seen in the act of defection. They
are taught to dig a hole in the ground away from the homestead or footpath and defecate there and then cover it over with earth or twigs. What is injurious to heaith is the habit of keeping all young stock in the women’s hut, where the young children also sleep. Bovine diseases such as ringworm, tuberculosis, and anthrax can be carried in this way and scabies are also
common. Consequently a large number of the Barbaig suffer from skin and eye diseases of one kind and another. The spirillum tick is, unfortunately, an uninvited guest of every homestead.</p>
<p>Barabaig have been accused of being lazy by both administrative and specialist officers. Their Native Treasury roads are without doubt the worst in the Northern Province, due not so much to laziness, as to the fact that few of them understand how to use a hoe or are used to working with earth. Give them an axe, as on the tsetse bush clearings, and they are outstanding workers. If one could see them on a lion hunt, chasing through scrub‘thorn bush for hours in the blazing sun, oblivious of the discomforts of scratches, thorns, antbear holes, and heat; or watering their cattle from wells thirty or more feet deep; it would be difficult then to say that they
are lazy. True, they preter to graze their cattle ten miles and back to surface water rather than to use a well a few miles away, but then their women and young boys can do this whereas they are not permitted by custom to work the wells. Furthermore, having to work interferes with
the interminable series of councils, beer drinks and festivals which highlights the dry season.</p>
<p>Barabaig are amazingly rational, especially as young aduits. They question their traditional ritual values, religious attitudes, and even their lot within their culture. This gives rise to covert under-currents of dissatisfaction and overtly causes continuous tensions, especially about the disparity of wealth, distribution of inheritance and status. The young men and women are aggressive, quick to anger, and if they have been unjustly treated by their own standard, which is not far removed from our own, they are very slow to forget and often as not take matters in their own hands and avenge themselves. Most Barabaig elders have at least one scar and often several on their heads, testifing to their aggressive nature.</p>
<p>The Barabaig women are self-possessed, aggressive and independent, I have often talked at great length with an elder only to have his wife tell me afterwards that most of what the old boy told me was lies and she would go on to tell me the truth. The old women, past child-bearing age, have great influence in clan proceedings, especially if they can count a goodly number of descendants. They are often found to have a fount of genealogical and clan knowledge which surpasses many male informants. When they die however, unlike the old and successful men, their spirits have no influence at all on the welfare of the tribe.</p>
<h2 id="ii-the-distribution-of-tatoga-ethnic-groups-in-tanganyika">II. THE DISTRIBUTION OF TATOGA ETHNIC GROUPS IN TANGANYIKA<a class="headerlink" href="#ii-the-distribution-of-tatoga-ethnic-groups-in-tanganyika" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Tatoga is the generic name of the large number of small scattered groups of pastoralists which are found in Northern Tanganyika. They regard themselves as Tatoga but their Bantu neighbours refer to them as Wataturu or simply Taturu. These sub-tribes of the Tatoga are numerous and it is possible that others exist that have not yet been recorded.</p>
<p>The Tatoga seem to have a word for everything, which is convenient for the Anthropologist bent on describing the various groups which make up the society. The largest group is “the people as a whole,”.or Tatoga, singular, <em>Taturnyant</em>. Next the sub-tribes are called <em>ewmojik</em>, or singular
<em>eimochant</em>. The following sub-tribes have so far been discovered, the Iseimajek and Rutageink in the Ruwana valley in Musoma District; a remnant of the Sirikwajek, who have been completely assimilated by Nandi, living in the Mount Elgon and Kapsabet areas of Kenya; the Buradik and Bajut in the Maswa, Nzega, Singida and Mbulu Districts living in border areas formed by the Eyasi, Sibiti and Wembere complex of swamps and rivers; the Bajut and Dororajek at Mongola and north of Mkalama; the Daragwajek, Reimojik, Mangat’k, Ghumbiek and Bianjit, living in the lower stretches of the Wembere and at Itigi and Muhalala; the Gisamajenk at Dongabesh, Bashonet and Karatu; the Salagwajek at Salawe in the Shin-
yanga District; and finally the Barabaig, the only group with a definite political boundary and a Native Authority, in Mbulu District at Katesh.</p>
<h3 id="the-sirikwajek">The Sirikwajek<a class="headerlink" href="#the-sirikwajek" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It has already been mentioned that some two hundred and fifty years ago the Tatoga lived in the Mount Elgon, Kapsabet areas of Kenya. Both the Nandi and Barabaig have historical myths connected with these people. The Nandi say that they were a populous cattle people who suddenly migrated leaving only a small remnant group which has become completely
assimilated to Nandi. Chief Isaiah Keina and his mother, of the Kapsabet District, are descendants of this remnant. Chief Isaiah said that in the past his clan were known as sirikwa kap gabandot. In Barabaig this would be stated as: <em>gaban dosh’t gaba sirkwa</em>; meaning, I am from the gate of the clan or sub-tribe Sirikwa. Furthermore, siriki in Barabaig means, old
fashioned, or the way of ancestors. An elder, Hena Misai of Itigi, stated definitely that his sub-tribe, the Mangat’k, and another, the Ghumbiek, were originally called the <em>sirikwajek</em> before they “became many so divided.”</p>
<p>The origin of the word <em>Mangati</em> now comes into question. We have always assumed that it came from the Masai word, <em>ol-mangatinda</em>, plural, <em>il-mangati</em>, meaning respected enemy as recorded by H. N. M. Harvey in the <em>Tanganyika Police Review</em>, No. 1, Volume one, page 19. When I asked a member of the Mangat’k sub-tribe, “Giwosji ana eimochant?” (what is your sub-tribe?), he replied, “Gaba Mangatiga.” (I am a Mangatiga), the singular of Mangat’k. This sub-tribe formerly lived in the Ngorongoro and Katesh areas and it is quite possible that they had contact with the Masai there. Today, however, the sub-tribes at Itigi state that Mangati is the name given erroneously to the Barabaig by the European.</p>

<h3 id="the-iseimajek-and-rutageink">The Iseimajek and Rutageink<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#the-iseimajek-and-rutageink" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>These groups, although close neighbours occupying the Ruwana valley and surrounding country are, according to informants, bitter enemies. The Iseimajek are fish eaters and have songs and ceremonies praising fish and prayers placating the ancestors to bring abundant supplies of them; where as the rest of the Tatoga groups maintain a fish avoidance equating them to snakes. The Iseimajek are a small <em>eimochant</em> numbering about one thousand, only half of whom live in the Ikizu and Issenge chiefdoms of the Musoma District while the rest are widely scattered throughout the other Tatoga areas. They are immediately identified by other Tatoga by their peculiar lisp when speaking. The Rutageink at Ruwana are more numerous than the Iseimajek but few are to be found in other areas. The Tatoga refer to this group as living at “Luank” and here the <em>sid a huck’t</em> (leader of the sub-tribe) of the Rutageink lives, one Gichabot Gabadanyek. The Rutageink and Iseimajek, of the Musoma District, together numbered
1,300 at the 1948 census. If, however, these <em>eimojik</em> are like the rest of the Tatoga, then the census figures can be doubled because the Tatoga, who live in not easily accessible areas, pay taxes only if they are forced to do so and moreover avoid contact with those who are bent on counting them or their cattle.</p>
<h3 id="salagwajek">Salagwajek<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#salagwajek" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This group, although they themselves do not recognise the name, have been referred to by many informants as the Salagwajek and live at Salawe in the Shinyanga District of the Lake Province. The 1948 census puts the population at 1,341 and it is possible that this is accurate in that the Salagwajek have been completely assimilated by the Sukuma and have lost every vestige of Tatoga language and custom. Indeed one would not know they were Tatoga apart from the fact that they and the Tatoga say that they are. It is known, however, that their genealogies reveal, in the fourth and fifth ascending generations, Tatoga names. Informants at Salawe told the writer that a former chief, Ntenga Kabelele, in German times made annual pilgrimages to Gidamowsa, the famous old witch doctor who lived at Basotu and who was hanged by the Germans for his political and magical activities. That involved the chief in an annual safari of over two hundred miles for medicines and advice. It is further stated that this chief and his family could speak the Tatoga language. The writer was astonished to hear
that the grandson of Gidamowsa, Gidananan, the wealthy present-day leader of the Bajut <em>eimochant</em> at Mangola, Mbulu District, made a visit to Salawe in 1949 to revive interest in his medicines and political direction. Here he was welcomed and given traditional hospitality by the father of the present chief, Keyu Shija.</p>
<p>Another interesting facet of the Salagwajek is that the first Tatoga was Salahog—<em>Salagwajek</em> meaning the people of Salahog. Although the Salagwajek have lost all of the Tatoga clan and generation structure, they could remember the word for an elder’s generation, which is <em>ishima</em> in
Tatoga. Further they claim that their ancestors came from the Bukoba area where they were driven out by the Watusi from a place called Nyalwelwe near the Urundi border. I have not yet been able to identify this place name on any map.</p>
<p>Salagwajek is really an atypical group and therefore will not be considered further for the purposes of this paper. They have been completely absorbed by the Wasukuma and present an example of what will happen shortly to those Tatoga living among the Iraqw and also what has all but happened to the Ghumbiek, Bianjit and Daragwajek at Itigi and Manyoni.</p>
<h3 id="buradik-bajut-and-dororajek">Buradik, Bajut and Dororajek<a class="headerlink" href="#buradik-bajut-and-dororajek" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The major concentration of these three <em>eimojik</em> is the Kyasi, Sibiti and Wembere complex although a few may be found in other Tatoga areas. The 1948 census records 318 in the Unyambiu chiefdom, Nzega District, and 928 in the Kimali and Meatu chiefdoms, Maswa District. This is a gross underestimation for at least another two thousand can be found in these areas. These sub-tribes under the leadership of Gidananan Unati, a Bajut of Mangola, Mbulu District, and Gitaros Gijank, a Buradik of Loya, Tabora District, appear to enjoy their relative safety from Government interference by living in the excellent cattle country provided by the vast marshy lowlying plains which stretch from the Southern shores of Eyasi to Itigi, a distance of some two hundred miles and inaccessible to Government officials for most of the year. It is unfortunate for the future of the Tatoga that some form of government could not be instituted in this vast no-man’s-land and a tribal boundary laid down. One of the problems is that the area
borders on the Mbulu, Maswa, Nzega, Tabora, and Singida Districts. To reach an agreement on such a border would therefore be impossible.</p>
<p>The Dororajek are a small <em>eimochant</em> who broke away from the Bajut and formerly inhabited the Karatu area of the Mbulu District before the encroachment of the tsetse fly. Today they are scattered throughout the other Tatoga groups. They are found living in greatest concentration
among the Bajut on the Sibiti, north of Mkalama.</p>
<h3 id="ghumbiek-mangatk-reimojik-daragwajek-and-bianjit">Ghumbiek, Mangat’k, Reimojik, Daragwajek and Bianjit<a class="headerlink" href="#ghumbiek-mangatk-reimojik-daragwajek-and-bianjit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>These five <em>eimojik</em> are listed in the 1948 census as numbering 1,912 at Itigi and Muhalala. This is no doubt correct. Members of these <em>eimojik</em>, however, can be found throughout the Singida side of the Wembere as far north as Sekenke with scattered groups at Tulia, Ntwike, Ngongila, and Endamotoa. The Bianjit are said to be a very small but old <em>eimochant</em> who, because of their lack of cattle, are chiefly cultivators. The Ghumbiek and Mangat’k are the people of Ghumbangaing, an early Tatoga ancester, brother of Salahog, who it is claimed was the first to enter what is now Tanganyika in the neighbourhood of Fuadi (the Tatoga name for Ngorongoro). There they were called Sirikwajek (i.e. the Sirikwa of Mount Elgon). They appear to have arrived in the Itigi area some two hundred years ago and are now almost completely assimilated by the local Bantu in house types, custom and family organisation. The generation names, clan names, and an intelligible dialect of their former language are still apparent. They have not yet become unidentifiable as have the Salagwajek of Salawe or the Sirikwa remnant of Elgon but it is just a matter of time before they will be completely absorbed by their Bantu neighbours.</p>
<h3 id="gisamajenk">Gisamajenk<a class="headerlink" href="#gisamajenk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to understand the rapid disintegration of the Gisamajenk of Dongabesh in the last fifty years in the face of Iraqgw and Government pressures and the encroachment of the tsetse fly. The Gisamajenk were formerly a war-like, thieving sub-tribe who attracted many scattered
groups of Tatoga who came to their area for protection. Today they number barely four thousand souls. When the early German explorer, Dr. Fritz Jaeger, [^4] visited the area at the turn of the century they must have made a lasting impression on him by their numbers and physical characteristics. He seems to have spent considerable time among them and took the trouble
to describe them in some detail and also to record many photographs. He called them the Wambulu and he scarcely mentioned the Iraqw who have overrun the area.</p>
<p>Early German maps refer to this district as the Tatoga Plateau. Today, however, it is almost completely inhabited by the rapidly increasing Iraqw. The last vestige of unity was lost a few years ago when the Gisamajenk chief, Gitageno, was replaced by an Iraqw sub-chief and the Native Treasuries combined. Today the Gisamajenk have not even a headman in an area which was indisputably theirs less than fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore they are being rapidly assimilated by the Iraqw, ‘most of them are bi-lingual and it is difficult to find a Gisamajenk in the Mbulu District who has not Iraqw blood. Their customs are changing rapidly and with forty years of Mission work among them many are Christians. They
still hold to their clan and lineage structure, however, and at the time of writing are making desperate efforts to recover political control of what appears to be a lost cause.</p>
<p>It has been said by many informants that the Barabaig broke away from the Gisamajenk fifty to sixty years ago. The myth which explains the separation varies depending on whether the informant is Barabaig or Gisamajenk. However, it is now established that only a small section of
Barabaig were formerly Gisamajenk and these were taken in by the bulk of the Barabaig who had complete control of the area known as the Barabaig Steppes, below the escarpment, for the last two hundred and fifty years at least. These Gisamajenk clans can still be identified although
they are now regarded as Barabaig.</p>
<p>The Gisamajenk, in this writer’s opinion, formed a later migration than the rest of the Tatoga groups and their customs are certainly more in line with Nandi. They were expert bowmen and arrow makers whereas the rest of the Tatoga relied mostly on the spear and stick. Further, their
shields were more highly developed and used for fighting, whereas among the rest of the Tatoga the shield was an ineffective defensive weapon and rarely carried in war. Moreover they also had a highly developed knowledge of poisons, which is not found among the rest of the Tatoga. The Gisamajenk have songs describing enemy raids which include the Tatoga among their enemies. Finally they were, as far as can be ascertained, partial cultivators when they came to the area, an aspect of economic mode which is only now beginning among most of the other Tatoga groups.</p>
<p>Today many Gisamajenk have left the Dongabesh area and scattered groups are to be found in every other Tatoga sub-tribe apart from that at Salawe. They are to be found in the border areas of the Singida-Mbulu Districts in small settlements and also along the Bubu River to the south
of Barabaig in Gorowa country.</p>
<p>This description of the <em>eimojik</em> gaba Tatoga now brings us to the Barabaig whom I shall go on to describe in fuller detail. It should be remembered, however, that not all of what is said about the Barabaig can be applied to the rest of the <em>eimojik</em>. Most is applicable to the Gisamajenk, Buradik, Bajut, Dororajek and Rutageink, however, and can be relied upon as a fair description of their tribal structure as well as that of the Barabaig. The Salagwajek, Bianjit, Daragwajek and Ghumbiek are so assimilated by their neighbouring Bantu that it is difficult to say how much of the data is or is not applicable without further study. Certainly it will provide a fair description of their former culture.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Despite the wide scattering of Tatoga groups in Tanganyika they still maintain a degree of contact which is quite unique. This has been noticed by many specialist officers; for example Mr. I. B. Pullen of the Veterinary Department noticed with interest that whenever bovine epidemics broke out among the Tatoga cattle on the Sibiti and Wembere, they could expect a similar outbreak about two months later in the Ruwana Valley roughly one hundred miles away.</p>
<p>The Salagwajek at Salawe, although completely assimilated by the local Sukuma, are still proud of the fact that they are Tatoga and welcomed the leading medicine man, Gidananan, to their fold only two years ago. Their chief in the past made annual pilgrimages for medicines and advice to Gidamowsa at Basotu. This maintenance of social ties between <em>eimojik</em> has become more difficult today, however, and the Tatoga at Salawe will be forgotten in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Apart from the maintenance of social contact the migration complex of the Tatoga must be considered at three levels. The historical migrations of the Tatoga people from Kenya and their settlement in Tanganyika is one facet which must be coupled with data on the segmentary principle in Tatoga society. What has caused the wide scattering of autonomous groups
which claim territorial grazing and water rights and each of which regards itself as an unique unit, <em>etmochant</em>, of the Tatoga as a whole? The second level is the semi-permanent migration patterns found within the territories of each eimochant. Why do groups of Gisamajenk, for example, leave “<em>en masse</em>” from Dongabesh and settle one hundred or more miles away in the
Wembere area of the southern Singida District? The third level is the seasonal migrations or semi-transhumance pastoralism practised by all of those <em>eimojik</em> who have not yet taken to agriculture.</p>
<h3 id="historical-migrations">Historical Migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-migrations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is always dangerous to elucidate on historical migrations and, although they present a useful and interesting mental exercise, it is difficult to speak of such reconstructions as factual or scientific. The migrations</p>
<p><insert image></p>
<p>of the Tatoga are, however, quite clear over the past two hundred and fifty odd years. Where they came from before that is a matter for speculation and beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<p>Another point which has always interested me is the assumption by anthropologists and others that migrations are necessarily slow whereas several migrations of Tatoga which were observed by this writer were anything but slow. Last year, for example, a group of Barabaig families
were burned out of the Hanang area by a bush fire. In less than two days they were settled thirty-six miles away in homesteads which, to the casual observer, might have been there for many years. Many Gisamajenk families were met living among other Tatoga groups several hundred miles from Dongabesh, which journey took them less than ten days.</p>
<p>When we say therefore that the Tatoga formerly inhabited the Mount Elgon area of Kenya and left suddenly, it is possible that within a month they were settled peacefully on the slopes of Hanang Mountain in the Mbulu District, which is about five hundred air miles away. The first
groups which arrived at Hanang Mountain and grazed into what ‘was called the Barabaig Steppes by the Germans were Mangat’k and Bianjit. The latter means land or territory. They must have arrived and been well settled before Ruida, a Buradik, the eponymous founder of the largest clans in Barabaig, arrived there about two hundred and fifty years ago. Ruida
found the Hanang area already occupied by Tatoga groups of the Bianjit, Daragwajek, Mungat’k, and Ghumbiek who were living among an agricultural people, the Gobreik, the Tatoga name for the Gorowa.</p>
<p>Informants state that when their grandfathers were alive the whole of the Barabaig Steppes were fly-free to Itigi and thus the whole area formed by the Eyasi, Sibiti, Itigi, Bubu, Basotu, Hanang and Yaida swamps was used by the Tatoga as grazing. The Bianjit used what is now
called Mianji dam, south of Singida, as their permanent dry-season watering point before the lake burst its bank and disappeared fifty or sixty years ago. The Ghumbiek migrated from the Hanang area because of conflict with Ruida and his followers to the Itigi-Manyoni area where they found the Daragwajek already installed. The closely related sub-tribes which are found there today followed them shortly after. They were cut off from the rest of the Tatoga by the encroachment of the fly along what is now the Mbulu-Kondoa, Mbulu-Singida border. The Barabaig within the memory of aged informants enjoyed grazing through to Singida where
there was adequate water. Nyangura, the founder of a large and influential clan, Hilbanyangura, regarded what is now Singida as his clan waters: the word Singida is the name of one of his sons who lived there for many years. The honours of this great war chief, Singida, are still sung by the Barabaig in their tribal war songs. His name means zebra, <em>singieida</em>, because he was born on the day a zebra was killed for medicines for his mother.</p>
<p>To the north of Hanang the powerful Gisamajenk of Dongabesh regarded their territory as including the eastern shores of Eyasi and Ngorongoro as well as the Yaida and Dongabesh to the escarpment. Several other <em>eimojik</em> lived with them for protection. Groups of the Iseimajek, Bajut, and Buradik were followers of the Gisamajenk until Ghambameid, a son of Ruida, defeated the Gisamajenk at a place called Dabil at the foot of the Mbulu Escarpment. During this battle the group which followed Ghambameid killed all of their enemies who were wounded or captured by beating them with sticks. From that date the followers of Ruida, who were originally Buradik, were known as <em>Barabaig</em>, meaning those who kill with sticks. We are able to place the rough date of Ghambameid by many genealogies which count back ten generations from men in their thirties. Barabaig marry in their late twenties so we can roughly estimate the time of Ghambameid as two hundred and fifty years ago. Ghambameid, unlike Ruida, Salahog, Ghumbangaing, and other mythical ancestors, did exist and his grave is still placated not only by members of his own clan and sub-tribe but also by individual Tatoga from several <em>eimojik</em>. The Tatoga groups at Itigi claim him as an ancestor although genealogies do not verify the fact.</p>
<h3 id="semi-permanent-migrations">Semi-permanent Migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#semi-permanent-migrations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Barabaig rarely move into strange country on their own but rather in groups of families, gheida, which are usually found to be related either by agnatic or affinal kinship ties. It is not unusual to find several young men: who are married to sisters or who have the age group relationship of the <em>raat</em>, that is, they have killed together, emigrating together with their families.</p>
<p>The Tatoga move for a variety of reasons. When asked they often reply that in their new-found land there is plenty of water and grazing. This is a supplementary reason; the chief reasons being overcrowding in their land of birth and/or the encroachment of an agricultural people.
Sickness among children or cattle of the <em>gheida</em> is sufficient reason to leave one area and to settle elsewhere. To migrate is the indigenous soiution to these problems by the Tatoga. Family, lineage, and recently Government conflicts, provide incentives to move. This is the only traditional answer to the patriarch of a lineage segment if conflict occurs and a basic aspect
of the segmentary principle in Tatoga society. The fact that the Tatoga have high mobility tempers the authority of the autocratic lineage heads. Another major cause of emigration is the news of relatives who have already emigrated and who have been successful in their newly found area. Others are encouraged to join them. Furthermore, a wealthy man collects clusters of younger sons of men who have few cattle. These young men, <em>somnyant</em>, plural <em>somnyek</em>, who have little to gain from their own pater adopt the wealthy leader and work for him in the hope that he will help them establish their own homesteads. The Tatoga also move to escape the multitude of rules and regulations of the modern Native Authority, such as road work, fly clearing, agricultural schemes, dam building, etc.</p>
<p>Migration is an inherent cultural pattern of the Tatoga which can be seen from their wide and scattered distribution from Kenya to Manyoni, from Mbugwe to Lake Victoria. Today, however, a political consciousness is beginning to develop among the sub-tribes, no doubt due to the loss of freedom to migrate which has come about as a result of bovine disease control and other Veterinary Department rules. Another factor which militates against migration is the political development which has taken place among those people with whom the Tatoga groups live. These groups are able, by Native Authority ordinance, to control immigration to their tribal lands and because of this many Tatoga groups have been forced to settle more or less permanently in one area.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlike their brother pastoralists, the Masai, the Tatoga have no vast area protected, preserved, and developed for them by Government. This is obviously due to their wide scattering and lack of indigenous political organization which the Masai have through their age-sets, and laibons.</p>
<h3 id="seasonal-migrations">Seasonal Migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#seasonal-migrations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>These <em>eimojik</em> of the Tatoga who do not practice agriculture have evolved methods of seasonal grazing and conservation which are practical adjustments to erosion and seasonal rains. Briefly, in Barabaig these methods are to graze into the low-lying swampy marsh lands as the rains
begin in November and to leave the highland well-watered areas of Hanang Mountain for the dry season grazing. These rules are enforced in each area by clan or community councils of elders, the <em>gisjod</em>. The Buradik, Bajut, Bianjit and Daragwajek are forced to reverse the practice because of physical factors. These sub-tribes graze the highland areas at the peak of the rainy season and then begin a slow migration into the Sibiti and Wembere plains as the waters recede. They remain in these vast marshlands until the rains begin in October and then retreat slowly, as the marshes fill up, to the highland areas where they arrive when the rains are once more at their peak.</p>
<p>(To be concluded in No. 35).</p>
