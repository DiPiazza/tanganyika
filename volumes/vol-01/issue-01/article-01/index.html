<h1 id="dar-es-salaam-under-the-sultans-of-zanzibar">Dar es Salaam under the Sultans of Zanzibar<a class="headerlink" href="#dar-es-salaam-under-the-sultans-of-zanzibar" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h3 id="sir-john-gray">Sir John Gray<a class="headerlink" href="#sir-john-gray" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I feel that I must open this article with an apology for being so presumptuous as to attempt to enlarge upon the work of such authorities as Clement Gillman and E. C. Baker, with whose intimate and extensive knowledge of the history of Dar es Salaam I can make no claim to be able to compete. My excuse is that these writers have dealt mainly with the history of the place during the period before Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar founded the town and during the period after the arrival of the Germans, and, whilst they have made references to the history of Dar es Salaam between those two events, they have not done so in any great detail. Certain events which occurred during that interim period appear to me to have a certain amount of interest and I am therefore venturing to put them on record.</p>
<p>Neither Arab chroniclers nor Portuguese writers have anything to tell us regarding the coast of Africa between Kilwa Kisiwani and Bagamoyo, but a string of ancient graveyards between those two places indicates that a number of settlements existed along this coast at various times. One such settlement existed on the raised coral cliff at Ras Chokir near where the Dar es Salaam European Hospital now stands. Another existed on the south side of the bay forming the entrance to Dar es Salaam harbour.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> At Ras Chokir there were at one time extensive traces of a town as well as of a large cemetery. The edition of the Indian Ocean Directory, which was published in 1882 (pp. 592, 593), tells us that the white tombs on the cliffs were at that date a prominent landmark, showing out well to sea. The 1897 edition of the African Pilot gives us similar information, but soon after the opening of the nineteenth century the tombs began to disappear. A few still remain and from time to time exceptionally heavy spring tides wash out skeletons from the soft crumbling cliff of this headland.</p>
<p>History is silent as to the date of the foundation of these settlements, but what is evident from the remains themselves is that, like many other settlements along the coast between Kilwa and Mombasa, they were occupied at one time by persons of mixed Asiatic and African blood, whom the Portuguese called “Moors” in contradistinction to ‘“Cafres,” and whom the Arabs call “people of the Swahili (coasts)” in contradistinction to the “infidels” (Kaffirs) of the interior. The settlers themselves as often as not styled themselves Washirazi, thus alleging, often with some measure of truth, a Persian ancestry.</p>
<p>The settlement at Ras Chokir was called Mzizima. It extended south-wards for a distance of about five hundred yards so as to include a village called Mjimwema. A German map of Dar es Salaam, which was published in 1891 and which has been reproduced with Clement Gillman’s article on “Dar es Salaam, 1860 to 1940” in No. 20 of Tanganyika Notes and Records, shows this last named place as comprising just over a dozen native huts, including one which has a compound suggesting that it was the residence of the headman. In 1947 there was still living a certain Mwinyiheri bin Akida, who claimed to have been born in the village on Ras Chokir itself.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Dr. Velten informs us that according to the traditions of Swahili elders  which he collected in 1896, the forest was first cleared by people from Barawa on the Somaliland coast and that thereafter “the Snirazi tilled the land, built boats, fished and traded in slaves.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> At some date or other these settlers came to be known as the Washomvi. Like other settlers at Kaole, near Bagamoyo, Konduchi and Mboamaji, they established their settlements in territory belonging te the Wazaramo. Presumably, the settlers made their bargains with the local inhabitants, but it is very evident that those settlements must have depended for their continued existence upon the goodwill of the Wazaramo and, when that goodwill was not forthcoming, upon assistance and support from outside the settlements themselves.</p>
<p>At some date, which can only be fixed very conjecturally as being about the beginning of the nineteenth century or the end of the previous century, the Wakamba made their way from their home in Kenya through Usagara down to the coast opposite to Zanzibar. According to one account they overthrew all the Masheha, or local chiefs, between Windi, about nine miles to the north of the mouth of the Kingani River, and the settlement on Ras Chokir. The inhabitants of the coast called to their aid a Mzaramo chief named Rukoli. After some very hard fighting in which the Wazaramo suffered considerable losses, the Wakamba were driven out and returned to their original home, leaving behind only a few isolated settlementsin Usagara.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>According to another account it so happened that, when Mzizima was thus threatened by the invaders, an Arab named Mohammad bin Shale El Hatmi had just beached his dhow which was laden with salt and other merchandise. The Shirazi elders persuaded Mohammad to lend them his cargo so that they might purchase the aid of the Wazaramo. When the Wakamba had been expelled, the Wazaramo were rewarded with land in the neighbourhood of Mzizima. It is also said that thereafter the Shirazi tacitly acknowledged the supremacy of their allies by paying tribute to them.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> As the inhabitants of that place were unable to repay their debt to him, Mohammad bin Shale liquidated it by marrying a daughter of one of the Shirazi leaders. Thus came into being the Shirazi-Hatmi clan, which took its name, Shomvi or Chomvi from the salt (chumvi), which had been brought in Mohammad bin Shale’s dhow.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Mgungunagwa bin Abubakar Mshomvyi, who ruled as Diwan at Unonio near Kondushi, left innumerable offspring whom he settled at various places along the coast. A grandson of his, named Mwinyikambi, whose grave is still to be seen near the explosives magazines at Magogoni, is said to have been the father of the Washirazi of Mzizima, though he never was installed as Diwan. He was the ancestor of two brothers named Mwinyikambi alias Kitembe and Mohammad alias Jalela, sons of Shomvihaji. both of whom ruled as Diwans of Mzizima. These two Diwans were buried near the present Secretariat at Dar es Salaam. Both tombs still exist. Kitembe’s grave being a big covered structure.</p>
<p>Tradition makes Kitembe a contemporary of Seyyid Majid bin Said, who was Sultan of Zanzibar from 1856 to 1870. It is said that in those days there was a Banyan named Mamula living at the place where Seaview now is. Mamula had a son who seduced Kitembe’s daughter. In revenge Mwinyishehe, the girl’s brother, strangled her seducer. The murdered man’s father complained to a half-breed Arab, named Said bin Abdulla El Marahubi. This man was the son of a prominent landowner in Zanzibar by a slave concubine, who belonged to the Pazi clan of the Wazaramo. Said bin Abdalla appears to have exercised at least as great authority in the district as the Diwan himself. He reported the murder to the Sultan of Zanzibar and at the same time informed him that Mzizima was a very fine country. Seyyid Majid decided to go and look at the place on the pretext of investigating the murder. He accordingly set out in a three-masted sailing ship. On arrival he ordered Kitembe to pay compensation to the Banyan’s relatives. At the same time the Washomvi and Wazaramo agreed to allow Seyyid Majid to build stone houses at Mzizima and to give him land for the cultivation of coconuts. Kitembe and his family had to mortgage a shamba close to Magogoni ferry to Said bin Abdulla in order to raise the compensation money payable to the Banyan’s relatives. In addition Seyyid Majid made Said bin Abdulla his akida (officer commanding troops) and put him in charge of his shambas which covered the areas of Gerezani and Kichwele.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>One is disposed to feel that this story has a substratum of truth but that it cannot be correct in all its details. Zanzibar Consular records have nothing to say about the murder at this date of a Banyan at Mzizima and one would rather have expected that the British Consul would have reported the matter to the Bombay Government, if such an offence had in fact occurred.</p>
<p>There is, however, evidence that at some date in the earlier half of the nineteenth century Arabs from Muscat and elsewhere were beginning to cross over in fairly large numbers from Zanzibar and to settle at various places along the opposite coast. For instance, we know that a certain Juma bin Mohamed El Nabhani settled at Mboamaji. According to custom he took unto himself a wife from amongst the daughters of Heth, marrying an African woman who bore him one son and two daughters. The son was named Muhammad and the eldest daughter was commonly known as Mwana Arabu. When their father had made his fortune, he returned to Muscat taking his son with him, but leaving his eldest daughter behind at Mboamaji. Eventually, Juma’s son, Muhammad, returned from Muscat to Mboamaji in company with a Muscat Arab named Rajab bin Said bin Muhammad El Marjebi. On arrival at Mboamaji Juma gave his sister Mwana Arabu in marriage to his companion Rajab. Mwana Arabu gave birth to a son, named Muhammad, who begot a son, whose proper name was Ahmed bin Muhammad El Marjebi, but who was better known to fame as Tippu Tib. It was from Mboamaji that this famous slave and ivory trader set out on his second journey to Tabora in the early 1860’s.<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Family histories such as that of Tippu Tib and his forebears must have been by no means uncommon. On the other hand, the European trader was deliberately excluded by the Sultans of Zanzibar from the most lucrative portions of the trade on the mainland. In the commercial treaty which Seyyid Said bin Sultan concluded with Great Britain in 1839 he specially reserved for himself a monopoly and the exclusive privilege of sale of ivory and gum copal between the ports of Mtangata and Kilwa Kisiwani. A similar reservation was made in the treaty which he concluded with France in 1846 and which his son, Seyyid Majid, concluded with the Hanseatic Republics of Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg in 1899.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> Whilst no such reservation was contained in the earlier treaty which Seyyid Said concluded with the United States of America in 1833, he vigorously protested in 1847 against an attempt by the American Consul to assert the right of Americans to trade on the mainland and, following upon his protest, no further attempt was made to maintain that right.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> As will be seen, this bar on trade in ivory and copal did not operate against Banyan and Muslim traders from India. many of whom came from the independent states of Cutch and Kathiawar.</p>
<p>Turning to European records, it is somewhat remarkable that neither Owen in the course of his hydrographical survey of the East African coast between the years 1822 and 1825 nor Guillain some twenty years later realised the existence of a large land-locked harbour to the south of Mzizima. Owing to stress of weather, the dhow in which the missionary Krapf was sailing in 1850 to Kilwa put into the harbour of Msasani to the north of Ras Chokir and stayed there some thirty-six hours, but the dhow by-passed the harbour just to the south when it continued its voyage.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1859 Burton and Speke reached the coast on their return from the discovery of Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria. Burton thus describes the event:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">

<p>We were detained at Konduchi for six days between the 3rd and 10th February …<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">50</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>One day we were surprised by the abrupt entrance of a youth, eminently North German in aspect. He announced himself as Dr. Albrecht Roscher, of Hamburg....  He stayed with us two days and then departed northwards.<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">51</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>Burton had a good deal more to say about Roscher than I have set out but, as much of it is uncomplimentary and also unjust, there is no need to repeat those remarks here. Burton is, moreover, wrong in saying Roscher went northward. In actual fact he landed at Konduchi on February 9 from the dhow, which had come from Zanzibar and which next day conveyed Burton and Speke to Kilwa. As happened with Krapf, their dhow by-passed the harbour at Mzizima. Burton tells us that “our course lay past the settlements of Msasani and Magogoni and the little Mbwezi river to Mboamaji, “rain water” in the Mission Map called Mburomaji, vulgarly Boromaji. The little port-village with jungle rolling up to the walls, and anchorage defended by the Simba Islets, is a favourite entrance to the East African interior.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Roscher likewise headed southwards, and not northwards, as Burton would have us understand. He, however, travelled overland and on foot. On February 10, the day of Burton’s departure from Konduchi, he reached Msasani. Two days later he reached Mzizima. On February 13 he crossed the harbour mouth and proceeded to Mageogoni.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">13</a></sup> There is no need to follow his later journeyings. Later in the year he reached the shore of Lake Nyasa a few weeks after Livingstone had reached its southern end. A few months afterwards he was murdered. As an explorer he may not have made any great discoveries, but to him at least belongs the credit of being the first European to set eyes on what is now called the harbour of Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>On September 26, 1860, Colonel Rigby, British Consul at Zanzibar. arrived at Bagamoyo with Speke and Grant on the first stage of the two latters’ journey through Uganda to Cairo.<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">14</a></sup> One of the objects of Rigby’s visit to Bagamoyo was to liberate slaves, who had been acquired by Indians. For this purpose he stayed in Bagamoyo until September 30 when Speke and Grant struck camp and set out on their first march into the interior of the continent. During his stay Rigby liberated the slaves of five Indian owners—residing in Bagamoyo, five other Indian owners residing at Konduchi, two other owners residing at Mzizima, and two others at Magogoni.<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">15</a></sup> The figures are not without interest as indicating the relative prosperity of the four places just named. By this date Bagamoyo was the recognised outlet for a caravan route leading from Lake Tanganyika to the coast. Another route, which branched from this route near the coast, proceeded according to Erhardt’s famous ”Slug Map” (compiled in 1855) to Mboamaji. As already seen, Burton and Speke diverged from the same route to Konduchi, which appears to have provided as much business for Indians at this date as did Bagamoyo. On the other hand trade at Magogoni and Mzizima (also marked on Erhardt’s map) was on a much smaller scale.</p>
<p>To those who know Dar es Salaam today it may at first seem a matter for surprise that the advantages of this landlocked harbour were not appreciated earlier than they actually were. In order to find the reason we must go back to the days before steam. The harbour entrance is narrow and tortuous and therefore difficult for a vessel which is not capable of quick manoeuvring. During spring tides the stream is strong in the harbour channel, especially towards or after low water, as it is then con- fined to the channel itself. The ebb tide sets eastwards over towards the islands, which serve as a breakwater to the harbour entrance, and there is a risk of a vessel being swept in on them. Steam or other mechanical power will enable a vessel to counteract these tendencies of tide and current, but a sailing vessel of moderate size could not answer its helm or manoeuvre so quickly, more especially when either monsoon was blowing in any strength. For dhows and the like the entrance to Dar es Salaam was tricky and risky. More or less open roadsteads such as Bagamoyo therefore had a greater attraction for them. Even such harbours as Mboamaji, Msasani Bay and Konduchi, which had the protection of outlying reefs, appear to have thrived as sea ports to a far larger extent than the one lying just to the south of Mzizima.</p>
<p>Another reason why the harbour did not attract Arab or other settlers earlier than it did was the hostility of the Wazaramo. In 1845 a French explorer named Maizan had been murdered a short distance inland from Bagamoyo at the instigation of Mazungera, whom Burton describes as the “Phazi”, a “chief of the Wakamba, a sub-tribe of the Wazaramu”.<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">16</a></sup> Owing to pressure from the French Government Seyyid Said was compelled to send a punitive expedition against Mazungera. The expedition followed the same course as a number of other expeditions against the same person. There was very little fighting. Such fighting as there was gave Mazungera time to make himself scarce and the expedition returned to Zanzibar, having made a prisoner of the man who beat the drum at the time of Maizan’s murder. His captors passed him off to the French Consul at Zanzibar as Mazungera himself.<sup id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Mazungera was to prove a source of trouble for several years to come. In 1861 he began to infest the caravan routes leading from the interior and to intimidate Banyan traders on the coast near Mzizima. Seyyid Suleiman bin Ahmed El Busaidi, the Governor of Zanzibar, led a force against him. Suleiman subsequently informed the British Consul, Colonel Pelly, “that he followed the Phazi to his main haunt, but the Phazi escaped through a postern into the bush,” whereafter, deeming that honour was. satisfied, Seyyid Suleiman returned to Zanzibar. Later in the same year the Banyans again complained that their lives and property were in danger and asked for the despatch of a punitive expedition. The Sultan sent a small force across to Magogoni, but this met with no greater success than the previous one and for precisely the same reason. Mazungera once again managed to make his getaway.<sup id="fnref:20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20">18</a></sup></p>
<p>According to accounts given to Dr. Velten in 1896 by Swahili elders, Suleiman bin Ahmed must have returned to Mzizima very shortly after this last expedition. He brought presents with him, having been commis- sioned by Seyyid Majid to acquire land from the local inhabitants for the building of a new capital.<sup id="fnref:21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21">19</a></sup> Seyyid Suleiman was an interesting personality. He had been born in about 1787 and was a distant cousin of Seyyid Said, father of Seyyid Majid. When Seyyid Said first visited Zanzibar in 1828, he left his cousin in charge there as Wazir, guardian and adviser to his favourite son, Khalid. In 1844 the British Consul Hamerton described Suleiman bin Ahmed as “not a clever man, but a kind, good sort of a person” who had much influence with the pagan chiefs on the coast of Africa.<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">20</a></sup> This statement sufficiently indicated that he was: pre-eminently suitable for the delicate task of inducing the local inhabitants to make grants of land to Seyyid Majid. The negotiations: went through quite amicably. The original acquisition included the areas of Gerezani and Kichwele.<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23">21</a></sup> Either at the same date or else a little later Seyyid Majid also acquired considerable areas of land at Kurasini and Upanga, which with those at Gerezani and Kichwele,<sup id="fnref:24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24">22</a></sup> were largely given over to cultivation of coconuts and rice. As a German map of 1891 shows, the land occupied by the Washomvi at Ras Chokir and Mjimwema remained in the undisturbed possession of its original owners, though, as already seen, other land nearer to the Magogoni ferry was apparently mortgaged to the Arab Said bin Abdullah El Marahubi, in order to satisfy a claim for blood money.</p>
<p>I can find no record of any building operations at Dar es Salaam until the latter days of 1865. On January 16, 1866, the British Consul at Fane Gae informed the Senior Naval Officer on the East Coast of Africa that he had issued a pass to sixteen of the Sultan of Zanzibar’s slaves to proceed to Dar es Salaam “to be employed on the works in progress there.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25">23</a></sup> As we learn from the sixth edition of the Indian Ocean Directory (pp. 589, 590), the stone for most of the buildings was taken from the islands which form the eastern breakwater protecting the entrance to Dar es Salaam harbour.</p>
<p>Later in 1866 Seyyid Majid paid a personal visit to his new capital. He was accompanied there by Dr. Seward, the acting British Consul, who on November 10, 1866, made the following report to the Bombay Government:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>“I have the honour to report the return of the Sultan after a ten days’ absence at Dar es Salaam, the proposed site of a new town on the mainland littoral a few hours’ steaming south of Zanzibar.</p>
<p>The Sultan is expending large sums of money upon the transport of building materials to this place, where he is at present erecting a palace, a port, and dwellings for his officials. His Highness hopes to form the nucleus at least of a trading port, whence caravan routes shall radiate into the interior and which bye-and-bye may connect with the northern and southern ports of Keelwa and Lamoo.</p>
<p>The conception is good but the one want of labour appears to be fatal to its realisation. No considerable body of slaves could be kept together there. Forty are said to have decamped during the short stay of His Highness. The settlements of Lamoo and Mombassa are flanked by tribes more dangerous to the fugitive slave than the Arab, but the ‘country behind Dhar Salaam has no such flight-restraining terror.</p>
<p>The capacity of the new port for shipping is of the best. A narrow but deep channel leads to a chain of harbours that extends several miles inland. These harbours receive the outflow of a river which never dries up. The narrowness of the leading channel is a drawback which only the presence of a steam tug can countervail. This want has been anticipated and a powerful steam tug ordered from Hamburgh.</p>
<p>The question of health is a serious one as affecting the future of Dar es Salaam. The Banians declare it to be a fever stricken place. scarce habitable during the rainy season, but then they are opposed to the withdrawal of trade from the time honoured depots on the coast. Concentration implies competition and lessens profits. Arabs are reluctant to patronise the new venture. Their slaves would flee. They too declare it unhealthy, but not loudly, for examples have been made of some who gave Dhar Salaam a bad character. The slanderers were flogged. The hale and robust air of every dweller whom during a recent visit I encountered gave no support, however, to its ill repute.</p>
<p>Its water supply appeared to be sufficient and good irrespective of the stream before mentioned. Shallow lakes, frequented by water fowl, were found in the immediate neighbourhood of the new site: and the Arab Governor drew my attention to numerous little hills (sic. ? wells) of beautifully sweet water percolating through the high banks of white aluminous marl.... (? adjoining) the first harbour.</p>
<p>As the soil is a sandy humus, the humus must be.... capable of growing either sugar or cotton, but its grain growing value is un- doubted. To attract cultivation, His Highness offers .... (? free land) in any reasonable measure to those who will undertake agriculture in its neighbourhood. The sole condition attached to the gift is that the land be made to yield produce and kept under cultivation.</p>
<p>I have stated that no considerable body of slaves could be kept together at Dhar Salaam unless their slave labour can be largely supplemented or entirely replaced by free labour. There is no hope of any extension of this projected mainland settlement and of the seeming prosperity which on the considerable island of Zanzibar is sustained by violent and purely artificial means.”<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">52</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>Building operations appear to have proceeded very slowly. The Sultan’s palace was still unfinished when Pere Horner of the Holy Ghost Mission visited the place in November, 1867.<sup id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">24</a></sup> Very little further progress had been made when Tippu Tib reached Dar es Salaam with a caravan from the interior on January 19, 1868. Tippu Tib had reached the place in the last week of Ramadhan. He found Seyyid Majid observing the fast in his unfinished palace. Tippu Tib’s biographer gives the following account of Tippu Tib’s stay:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>For the time being things were lively in Dar es Salaam. All who belonged to ‘society’ had proceeded with the Sultan’s Court to the new capital. All the non-trading Consuls and a great number of other Europeans, all the better-class Arabs from Zanzibar, Pemba, Mombasa and Lamu, as well as a great body of Indians, had followed the Sovereign. Among the latter were all the creditors of Tippoo Tib, in whom the arrival of the caravan naturally evoked great delight: for on seeing the rich spoil in ivory they felt certain of receiving back the money they had advanced with high interest. But beside this the coming of the caravan excited the greatest interest in all circles as being the first one bound for the coast to reach the new capital. The Sultan himself showed interest in the daring voyager, whom he loaded with high honours and entertained as his guest until the ‘Great Feast’, which concludes the month of fasting (Known in Turkey as the ‘Festival of Bairam’).</p>

<p>A   fter the feast the whole Court returned to Zanzibar in three ships, headed by the Sultan and his notables and the foreign representativeson board a French man-of-war, while the remaining Arabs and the Indians followed in two smaller vessels.<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">25</a></sup></p>
<p>In July, 1863, H.M.S. “Daphne” called at Dar es Salaam. Her commanding officer, Captain G. L. Sulivan, gave the following account of the visit:</p>

<p>Dr. Kirk being anxious for an interview with the Sultan, who was at this time residing at his palace on the mainland at Darra Salaam, asked me to convey him across in the “Daphne” previous to our final departure for the south; thither therefore we proceeded, having on board Dr. and Mrs. Kirk and their baby, for whom a patent cradle was constructed out of the lid of a box and two chairs.</p>

<p>Bishop Tozer also formed one of the party; he had had a severe attack of fever, and I had persuaded him to accompany us for change of air, that of Darra Salaam being cool and refreshing, as compared with the low, marshy, fever and dysentery producing isle of Zanzibar, and he returned with us at the end of a week quite another man.</p>
<p>It had just become the Sultan’s new abode, he having built himself a palace here; another building had also been erected, a kind of official hotel for foreign consuls, or others, on their visits from Zanzibar, and there Dr. and Mrs. Kirk took up their abode, the Bishop remaining on board. At the end of the week we returned to Zanzibar.”<sup id="fnref:29"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:29">53</a></sup></p>

<p>Captain Sulivan took a photograph of Dar es Salaam, which has been reproduced as an engraving in his book “Dhow Chasing.” The half-fortress, half-palace of Seyyid Majid is therein depicted with a flag flying on its roof. Behind it is a mosque. It is not easy to make out which of the other buildings is the hotel. The photograph shows that quite a number of substantial and well built houses had been more or less completed by this date.</p>
<p>In 1870 a Select Parliamentary Committee on the East African Slave Trade recommended that certain measures should be taken for the reduction of the traffic in slaves with an ultimate view to the final abolition thereof. They recommended that the shipment of slaves from the mainland should be confined to one port and that that port should be Dar es Salaam, where a Consular Officer should be posted. The British Government adopted these recommendations and drafted a treaty for presentation to the Sultan of Zanzibar. H. A. Churchill, the British Consul at Zanzibar, embodied the terms, including the provision confining the exvort of slaves to Dar es Salaam, in an Arabic letter addressed to Seyyid Majid. Churchill later reported that the Sultan “took some time to consider the matter, and at last, being pressed, he said he would discuss the question with me and wanted me to go over with him to the coast for that purpose. I was prepared to go, but he was so ill at the time that he begged me to put it off until he could send me notice; instead of that he came back himself and ten days after that he died.” Seyyid Majid died on October 8, 1870, and his brother Seyyid Barghash succeeded to the throne. Whilst Majid was still living, Barghash had assured Churchill that, in the event of his succeeding his brother, he would comply with the wishes of the British Government. But on October 10, when reminded of his promise, “he repudiated everything and said that he had made no arrangement whatsoever; that he had never promised anything; that it was false, and even had he done so, he was not Sultan. then.”<sup id="fnref:30"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:30">26</a></sup></p>
<p>There were other signs that there had arisen a new ruler in the land who was anxious to break with much of the immediate past. In the early days of Majid’s reign Barghash had attempted to supplant his brother by force of arms. For this he had been temporarily. banished to India, but had been allowed after some time to return to Zanzibar. Though outwardly there had then been a reconciliation between the two brothers, it was notorious that neither had ever forgiven the other. It was consequently almost instinctive in Barghash to decline to further any of his brother’s projects. Amongst other things he washed his hands entirely of all schemes for the development of Dar es Salaam. So long as Seyyid Majid held court there, it had been a centre of attraction for business, which would otherwise have gone elsewhere. When Seyyid Barghash withdrew his patronage, all the recently created prosperity of Dar es Salaam vanished. As already seen, there had been a number of Banyans and Arabs, who had cried down the place in Seyyid Majid’s time. Now that there was no Sultan to chastise them with whips for so doing, their voices were raised again and a ready ear given to them by Seyyid Barghash.</p>
<p>On April 15, 1872, Dar es Salaam met with a further setback in the shape of a hurricane, which set in from the S.S.W. and reached as far as Bagamoyo on the mainland. It did great damage to shipping, buildings and plantations in Zanzibar, but does not appear to have wrought the same havoc on the mainland. Two buoys, which were moored outside the entrance to Dar es Salaam harbour, were washed ashore. It is somewhat typical of the utter lack of interest of Seyyid Barghash in the place that ten years later neither of these buoys had been restored to its proper position.<sup id="fnref:31"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:31">27</a></sup></p>
<p>In about July, 1873, a dispute arose about a woman between a slave of Seyyid Barghash and a member of the local tribe. In the course of the dispute one of the local inhabitants was killed. Thereupon his fellow tribesmen demanded the life of the slave as of right. The Akida referred the matter to the Sultan and was ordered on no account to give up the slave and to attack the natives, if necessary. No actual fighting took place, but on hearing the orders of the Sultan, the local inhabitants stopped sending in produce from the interior. Shortly afterwards feeling was further intensified when another native was assaulted and severely wounded by one of the Sultan’s soldiers, despite his protest that he had nothing to do with the people in the original dispute. The Akida paid a large sum in compensation to the wounded man, but the trade boycott was even more rigidly enforced and all local barter ended. The result was that in about September, 1873, a number of Banyans and Khojas removed to Magogoni, Tuliani, and other neighbouring villages, where a brisk copal trade rapidly sprang up, to the prejudice of Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>In December, 1873, Vice-Consul Elton visited Dar es Salaam, Magogoni and Tuliani. His primary duty was to emancipate slaves held by Indians under British jurisdiction and protection. When called upon to declare the number of slaves held by them the members of the Indian community declared only twenty-four, but subsequent enquiries produced sixty-four more. All these were emancipated and in one bad case the owner was prosecuted and fined. Prosecution in another equally bad case was impossible because the owner implicated set off for Zanzibar on the day of the Vice-Consul’s arrival at Dar es Salaam and returned on the day of his departure.<sup id="fnref:32"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:32">28</a></sup></p>
<p>On January 7, 1874, Elton wrote a report on Dar es Salaam, which is so full of interest that it deserves to be set out in full:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>The Sultan’s residence is built at the inland extremity of the basin, and is to the far right of the town, and from it a line of stone houses should form a crescent facing the anchorage, with a broad road and flights of steps communicating with the sandy beach, on the inner line of which wells, affording a good supply of fresh water, are conveniently constructed. But time, neglect, and weather are rapidly destroying the steps, terraces, and wells; only two of the houses are habitable, and the others are stopped short at the first storey, a low thatched barn does duty for the Custom-house in the broad overgrown field which marks the site allotted by Seyed Majid for the erection of a more pretentious structure; the boldly designed main streets are choked up with rank grasses and bush-wood, the houses of the most part deserted and locked up, or giving way to decay, except at one enterprising corner where a few Indians industriously strive to revive a failing trade with the interior. House property is almost valueless, and land around so depreciated that a plantation of some extent was shown me for sale, at a price of 40 dollars. A plot of land and a half-finished house in the centre of the town, mortgaged about two years ago for 500 dollars, would not fetch a reserve of 200 dollars when offered lately by auction; at the same time a thatched hut and two acres, in a good situation, went for 7 dollars. Yet the climate is healthy, the air clear, and fevers uncommon and easily shaken off,—so say the inhabitants,—the site a beautiful one, and the surrounding country green and well wooded; nevertheless there hangs about the scene a gloomy appearance, and the idea suggested itself that the desolation must be connected with the smash of some limited liability company, which has been compelled to stop work, and failed to attract the public by its preliminary outlays to see the advantages of a new seaside settlement.</p>
<p>The Akhidah, Rashk Allah, an Arab of Sheher, represents the Sultan’s authority, and is supported by a few mercenaries, Arabs, Baluchis, and half-castes. A guard is kept at his house, where there are a quantity of muskets, matchlocks, and old powder-horns stored for the purpose of equipping the 200 slaves, who work on Barghash’s extensive plantations, in case of disturbances with neighbouring tribes. Two or three Arabs pine on the outlying estates, and a host of the Mrima half-castes idle and shuffle about the town and adjacent villages, living from hand to mouth on the produce of their slaves, and on small trading ventures which they send in their charge towards the Uzaramo country.</p>
<p>The Indian community of Dar es Salaam is represented by:— 1 Wannia; 13 Battiahs; 1 Mooltani; 3 Bhoras and 3 Khojas, with families; whilst in the neighbouring villages, where the copal trade has gone, Magogoni contains 13 Battiahs, 1 Bhora and 3 Khojas; and Tuliani, 10 Battiahs and 10 Khojas, the latter with families.</p>
<p>A primary mistake was made by an attempt to force the Dar es Salaam trade, to the prejudice of other ports further north, which had before enjoyed the monopoly of caravans from the interior, for, after a glimmer of success, the death of Seyed Majid, and the withdrawal of patronage from the town, was at once followed by the natives resuming the popular and old times. It is now a long period since any caravan of value has been down, although the people live on rumours of a rich arrival en route; a small quantity of ivory, it is true, did reach from Unyamwezi during my stay, but it represented the venture of one man, and had no influence upon local trade. Ivory pays to the Dewan a “Moorba” of 3 dollars per frasilah, when brought in by those tribes of the Washenzi, who trade habitually, or by Arabs, or by Waswahili, and a further 12 dollars per frasilah on arrival at Zanzibar. If brought in by Washenzi, who are not habitually traders to the port, it pays 6 dollars per frasilah to the Dewan, but 9 dollars at Zanziar. Thus, in each instance, the total amount of duty per frasilah, 15 dollars, is the same. A few tusks find their way down from high (? the high- lands) into the Uzaramo country, where elephants are still said to be found in considerable numbers. The india-rubber liana is in abundant quantities in the close vicinity, and, at one time was exported largely at from 9 dollars to 10 dollars a frasilah. Its collection was stopped in consequence of leopards attacking boys gathering the juice, several being killed, and a fall in price; and it is now being destroyed wholesale, together with the copal trees, in the extensive clearings carried on by the Sultan, in order to add to his land under cultivation. These plantations are thickly planted with coconut trees, as yet young, and muhogo; some fine mango trees are to be seen, but the oil tree palms introduced are progressing but slowly. Wax is seldom brought in now by the Washenzi; the copal is almost entirely diverted to Magogoni and Tuliani. At these latter villages, towards evening, armed parties appear with the gum and spend the night in bargaining with the Indians, 2 dollars are often asked for what is worth 6d., and long and difficult negotiations invariably precede the handshake which cements the deal, but this once given no dispute is known to follow . Millet, Indian corn, and rice, of several varieties, senna, and bungala are grown throughout the district, which exports to Zanzibar, but (? not) to a great extent.</p>
<p>The copal trade, intermixed with grain speculations, and the lending moneys and goods at a rate of 8 per cent per mensem to small traders who sneak about the upper lands and are seldom absent for more than three months at a time on a single venture, these are the commerce of the Indian. Lower down in the Chungu-bueni district, and the fine Kwale district, he would find more copal, more ivory, more general trade, but would there have to pay blackmail on all his profits to half-a-dozen self-styled Sultans. Here he is effectually protected from oppression, the Sultan’s authority being maintained, and, although he sighs for the greater gains, yet he deems it prudent to be in a secure atmosphere, and away from the slave caravan line end its lawless followings, and in the main he is, I think, right.</p>
<p>The slave caravans strike the coast above Dar es Salaam, turning off from the Kisiju road, near Mboamaji, and making for the Dar es Salaam river, which they cross about five miles from the sea, near Seyed bin Abdullah’s (a worthless, cringing Arab, and a wine-bibber), from thence their path passes through the Sultan’s plantations and skirts close past the town. The straighter road, via Tuliani and Magogoni, is now seldom adopted as the ferry over the entrance to the river, which must be crossed, presents a danger. Their numbers and their destination might here become known, and they fear in- formation finding its way across to Zanzibar. Recently, the caravans have so increased in size and numbers, that the Akidah, who, as a rule, avoided the subject, one day expressed his astonishment, and went so far (he, an Arab of Sheher with natural Slave Trade propensities) as to say ‘he had never seen anything so shameful, it was only killing man, not trading.’</p>
<p>Religion does not cause dissension in the Dar es Salaam district. The Shafis and the Bohras coalesce in many points, the Khojas follow their own line quietly, whilst the prejudices of the Battiah are never wantonly outraged; neither do politics ruffle the pool with more than a passing ripple. One day resembles another with its money making and eternal gossiping, and pleasant idling; ample regrets follow relations of the past prosperity when Seyed Majid was King, and caravans headed by flags and men firing guns swaggered through the street to receive royal presents, and men of high estate from Zanzibar spent their revenues open-handed; but nothing is done, Barghash is pronounced ‘the unlucky’, and tomorrow is a counterpart of yesterday.</p>
<p>Yet that the country presents admirable facilities for sugar growing, even for European settlements ,is evident to all. It appears the one healthy spot on the Mrima; cattle thrive, it is pleasant to the eye to rest upon; alluvial, well-wooded plains roll back to the Uzaramo hills and the neighbours, undisturbed, are harmless.</p>
<p>The slave population appears fairly well off in the district: food is cheap, and fish plentifully caught all along the coast and in the river. Miles of staked enclosures fronting the sea form preserves, which are fished and re-fished assiduously, and boats work the outlying banks for ‘bonito’. During the three ‘days to themselves’, commonly given to slaves, they collect large quantities of salt with which they do a small trade, and manage to secure something for daily necessaries.”<sup id="fnref:33"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:33">54</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>In 1877 the process of gradual! deterioration was to some extent checked when work was begun on what was afterwards known as the Mackinnon Road. The scheme was promoted and paid for by Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Mackinnon and the second Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton. Their object was to open effective communication for wheeled traffic with Lake Nyasa and by that means to develop legitimate forms of commerce between the coast and the interior and thus gradually to eradicate the slave trade. The completion of the road was regarded as a matter of vital urgency and the first working party was instructed to commence operations and not to lose time in making preliminary explorations. On Kirk’s advice work was begun at Dar es Salaam.<sup id="fnref:34"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:34">29</a></sup></p>
<p>By July, 1877. six miles had been completed, but one serious obstacle had already come to light. Edmund Buxton, brother of Sir Thomas, reported that he had discovered tsetse fly in the low hills near the coast. This virtually destroyed all hope of using bullock or donkey transport on the road. Nevertheless, the work went ahead and by Sentember, 1877, fifteen miles had been completed. Then Mazungera, the descendant and namesake of Maizan’s murderer, tried to bar the way by demanding pay- ment for permission to proceed. When news of this reached Zanzibar, the Sultan instructed his Akida at Dar es Salaam to proceed with an armed force to the spot and put an end to this obstruction. The arrival of the troops had the desired effect. The opposition melted away and the work proceeded as before.<sup id="fnref:35"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1879 four elephants made their way up this road into the interior. These animals were not denizens of Africa. They had been acquired through William Mackinnon’s instrumentality in Bombay by the International African Association, which had been established under the auspices of Leopold II of the Belgians to promote the exploration and civilisation of Africa. The elephants had been conveyed together with ~ their mahouts across the Indian Ocean in the “Chinsura,” a steam vessel of two thousand tons. It was deemed unsafe to take the vessel into Dar es Salaam harbour. The ‘“Chinsura” therefore anchored in Msasani Bay on May 31, 1879. One animal was lowered into the sea by the ship’s derricks and after some demur was persuaded by its mahout to swim to the land. Next day the “Chinsura” was taken closer inshore and the remaining three animals were landed. They were taken thence to Dar es Salaam, whence they set out on July 2, 1879, along the Mackinnon Road on the first stage of their journey to Lake Tanganyika. Only one of the four reached its destination, the other three dying on the way. The sole survivor reached Karema on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in December, but soon suffered the same fate as its companions.<sup id="fnref:36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36">31</a></sup></p>
<p>In the meantime the Mackinnon Road was gradually penetrating further into the interior. By the end of 1879 it had reached its fortieth mile.<sup id="fnref:37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37">32</a></sup> in 1881 Kirk visited the road which had by this time extended seventy-three miles inland. Previous visitors had formed a poor opinion as to the manner of its construction and its potential value as a means of communication.<sup id="fnref:38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38">33</a></sup> But Kirk was a bit more comnvlimentary. He thought that on the whole it was well constructed and would require little labour to keep it open. But animal transport was out of the question and the road had not so far taoped any highway of commerce. In Kirk’s opinion it was never likely to become a trade route to Lake Nyasa, though William Mackinnon and Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton were to be con- gratulated “on the benefit conferred by them on the country.”<sup id="fnref:39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39">34</a></sup></p>
<p>We hear no more of any progress on the Mackinnon Road after Kirk’s visit. It was a private venture. Lake Nyasa lay more than four hundred miles beyond roadhead and at the then rate of progress it would take another twenty-five years to complete the task. Kirk’s report had come the nearest to bestowing any benediction on the enterprise and even that had hardly been more than damning with faint praise. In the circumstances one is not surprised to learn that the undertakers gave up the stupendous task. Six years later, according to Dr. Franz Stuhlmann, the road had “become deteriorated and overgrown as it was no longer used as a road.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:40">35</a></sup> Nevertheless it was still discernible in 1894 when Lieutenant von Schlobach of the German army made a survey of the proposed railway between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro. In his report this officer says: “Past Yombo to beyond Kongoromboto my railway trace follows the Mackinnon Road which it then leaves to gain Kiserawe Mission by a north-westerly development .... About one kilometre beyond Kiserawe the railway trace again reaches the Mackinnon Road and follows it down into Mpiyi valley.”<sup id="fnref:41"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:41">36</a></sup> There consequently would appear to be little doubt that, except for a few deviations, the present motor road between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro follows the same alignment as did the Mackinnon Road for its first seventy miles.</p>
<p>Mackinnon and Buxton did not labour entirely in vain. As the former once said of a subsequent East African undertaking of his, he and his colleague could claim to have taken out their dividends in philanthropy. In other words, Kirk was right when he said that they had conferred a benefit on the country through which their road passed.</p>
<p>The local inhabitants very soon began to appreciate the advantages of the road. In July, 1877, as many as a hundred natives a day were stated to be using the road bringing rice, india rubber and copal into Dar es Salaam.<sup id="fnref:42"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:42">37</a></sup> When Lieutenant Henry O‘Neill visited Dar es Salaam in the early days of 1879 he reported that the Wazaramo were doing a lucrative trade in rubber, which they sold “to the buyers on the road” and that about 1,000-1,500 frasilas (35,000-52,500 lbs.) had been exported from Dar es Salaam during the preceding twelve months. There were also extensive traces of copal digging. In fact, “the country has become almost honeycombed by it, and it is almost dangerous for the passage of any beasts of burden.” In addition, “a few trees here and there in the country surrounding Dar es Salaam represent what at one time must have been a dense copal forest,” but O’Neill was unable to form an estimate as to the quantity shipped from the port.<sup id="fnref:43"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:43">38</a></sup></p>
<p>This report was fully confirmed by Dr. Kirk two years later. He found copal trees existing throughout Uzaramo, but most of the copal was obtained by digging for the semi-fossil resin. According to him rubber was obtainable in such abundance that not even the reckless mode of tapping employed by the natives had seriously affected the supply.<sup id="fnref:44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44">39</a></sup></p>
<p>Nearer to Dar es Salaam a number of coconut plantations had come into being. Some were owned by the Sultan and others by private land- owners. Native tradition has it that one of the very first acts which Seyyid Majid did after acquiring land near Mzizima was tc send for some Arabs and say to them, “plant the seeds which I shall send you from Unguja (Zanzibar) and till my land in this country.”<sup id="fnref:45"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:45">40</a></sup> Doubtless the planting of these seedlings was partly intended as an outward and visible symbol of the Sultan’s entry into possession, but it was also a case of sound husbandry. In 1879 O’Neill reported that the Sultan’s plantations contained about 36,000 trees of which about three-fifths were bearing. In addition, some 2,000-3,000 seedlings had been planted during the last two years.<sup id="fnref:46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Though the explorer Keith Johnston, writing in 1881, had little to say in praise of Mackinnon Road, he had to admit that it carried a considerable amount of traffic. Writing in the same year Kirk said:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>The Wazaramo, who have been brought under the influence of the road, are one of the most degraded and troublesome tribes on the coast, and until the country had been opened up it was unsafe for any but an armed party to attempt to pass. Being cowards, they took advantage of the dense jungles and thickets through which the narrow paths had to pass, and kidnapped and plundered stragglers, thus extorting payment. Their utter weakness has now become manifest wherever the road has reached, and any one may traverse the country es it and without danger of molestation if only he follows the road.</p>
<p>On the people themselves also an influence has been obtained, for I notice that along many miles of road they had formed extensive fields in the adjacent lands, and had commenced to settle in open and cleared spaces, leaving their stockaded villages in the jungle.<sup id="fnref:47"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:47">55</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>Kirk also hoped that the road might prove an effective check in the overland traffic in slaves. For some time past, in order to escape the vigilance of British men-of-war, slaves from Kilwa and other places to the south had been marched overland to such ports as Pangani and Tanga and conveyed thence surreptitiously in canoes or small vessels to Zanzibar and Pemba. The Mackinnon Road cut right across this coastal route and there is no doubt that, if the Sultan of Zanzibar’s troops had effectively patrolled the road, many of the slave caravans could have been intercepted and the slaves rescued. But Kirk was constantly complaining of the non possumus attitude adopted by the Akidas commanding the Sultan’s troops in Dar es Salaam. However, in justice to those officers it must be allowed that the personnel upon which they had to rely was most unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>In 1873 the Wazaramo had been plundering travellers near Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam and the Sultan’s irregular troops had been called out to deal with the situation. The campaign appears to have followed the same form as previous ones. As soon as the soldiers appeared, the enemy disappeared and no attempt was made to round up the offenders. Soon thereafter Lieutenant O’Neill reports that:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>Relations between the Sultan’s authorities at Dar es Salaam and the Wazaramo, with whom they came in contact during the late war, flavour somewhat of an armed neutrality and the soldiers are even now afraid of proceeding through the country thirty miles in the interior, unless in such force as to withstand any reprisals that may be made. Two, who were ordered to accompany me by the Akida absolutely refused to proceed with me beyond the ‘bungalow’ (sc. on the Mackinnon Road), where a force of ten is stationed, alleging the hostile feeling on the part of the natives to be the cause and I believe that, until this feeling has subsided, it would be safer for European travellers to walk alone than to be accompanied by such an escort.<sup id="fnref:48"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:48">56</a></sup>.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1880 a native interpreter on board H.M.S. “Ruby” reported that slave caravans from the south were stooping short of Dar es Salaam at Mboamaji, whence slaves were transported either to the island of Uzi off the south coast of Zanzibar or else were being sent round the east coast of Zanzibar to Pemba.<sup id="fnref:49"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:49">42</a></sup> When Kirk himself visited Dar es Salaam a year later he learnt “that in Dar es Salaam itself there is an amount of transfer of slaves from hand to hand which could not be the consequence of local wants alone,” and the situation required “more careful watching than I am able to give.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">

<p>The Sultan’s headman, a chief of the handful of irregulars, for there is no Governor, is not a person who impressed me on this occasion favourably, and I have mentioned this to His Highness. The slave trade here is, however, very small, and the few gangs that pass are taken away from the coast. They could, however, easily be stopped by the soldiers if the local official had a wish to do so. It has, however, of late not been found convenient to pass so far north as Dar es Salaam, and slaves are shipped in canoes or small dhows from native villages further north. The numbers, however, so shipped are comparatively small, and could easily be reduced if an active officer were stationed at Dar es Salaam.<sup id="fnref:50"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:50">57</a></sup></p>

<p>In the latter part of 1884 a famine in Uzaramo led to an overt increase in the slave trade in Dar es Salaam. An interpreter, whom Kirk sent over to investigate the murder of a Banyan, reported that the Wazaramo were living on wild grass, seeds and roots. The inhabitants of one village were kidnapping those of another and fathers were selling their children for food. The interpreter saw over three hundred slaves in the village of Mjimwema. He got wind of the fact that an Arab was shipping twenty-seven slaves to Pemba and informed the Liwali of Dar es Salaam, who, however, acted with such remissness that only one slave was rescued, though the owner was captured.<sup id="fnref:51"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:51">43</a></sup> A few days later H.M.S. “Philomel” seized another dhow at Dar es Salaam with 108 slaves on board.<sup id="fnref:52"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:52">44</a></sup> On November 17 the pinnace of H.M.S. “Turquoise” rescued another seven slaves from a dhow in Msasani Bay, but the crew managed to escape.<sup id="fnref:53"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:53">45</a></sup> The trade was still being carried on in the following year deep lie the fact that the acute famine was over.<sup id="fnref:54"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:54">46</a></sup></p>
<p>It was not until the Germans took over Dar es Salaam from the Sultan of Zanzibar, and effectively occupied the adjacent hinterland, that the last of the Arab slave traders was overthrown and the overseas traffic in slaves was destroyed.</p>
<p>The fourth edition of the Indian Ocean Directory (p. 594) describes Dar es Salaam as it was in 1882 in the following words:</p>

The remainder of the stone buildings, with two exceptions, are roofless, and look more like ruined houses than uncompleted ones, en account of the vegetation which climbs round them. There is, however, a considerable population living in the mud huts around those ruins, and the village of Mjimwema may be said to be part of Dar es Salaam. There is a governor, with a guard of the Sultan’s soldiers, and a customs-house official.</p>
<p>A large tract of land at the back is planted with coconuts, belong- ing to the Sultan, and will bring in no inconsiderable revenue in a few years. There is already a little trade with the interior, caravans of ivory occasionally arriving for shipment to Zanzibar. A road is in course of construction for wheeled traffic between the town and the north end of Lake Nyasa....</p>
<p>There are several good wells. The best and most convenient is in the Sultan’s grounds at the back of his palace. There is another at the mosque close to a small house with a dome, but there is some difficulty about boats filling their barricoes there, though it is outside the mosque wall. A third is at a Banyan’s house, some way inland to the N.E. The well, which is most conveniently situated close to the beach, in the bank to the East of the unfinished buildings, should be carefully avoided.”</p>
<p>On February 23, 1886, Dar es Salaam was visited by Colonel (afterwards Field Marshal Earl) Kitchener and his French and German colleagues on the International Commission for delimitation of the boundaries of the Sultan of Zanzibar’s mainland dominions. At that date the town had a population of five thousand. Of these 107 were Indians (45 Bohoras, 14 Hindus and 47 Khojas). Another hundred were members. of the Arab garrison and there were also 600 or 700 slaves working on the Sultan’s plantations.</p>
<p>The town was in charge of a Wali, named Muhammad bin Suleiman El Haruni, an Arab of Muscat, who had at that date held the post for four years. He laid claim to the exercise of jurisdiction over the tribes in the hinterland to a distance of one month’s march from Dar es Salaam but, as further interrogation showed that he was surprisingly ignorant of the chiefs and peoples of those countries, that claim must be considerably discounted. He stated that on the previous day people had come from Ras Kimbiji, about 25 miles S.E. of Dar es Salaam, to obtain his adjudication on a matter of inheritance, ‘and that he would cause to be arrested any party who should refuse to submit to his judgment.” He also informed the Commission that there were six to seven “important natives’, who lived on plantations several hours’ march inland, “who go each year to Zanzibar to pay a visit to the Sultan.”</p>
</div>
<p>The Customs Master at Dar es Salaam was a Hindu, named Bhanji Wadowji, who, to judge from the answers he gave to the Commission, was a gentleman of sedentary habits. He stated that:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>The only places under his orders outside of Dar es Salaam are the customs-houses of Magogoni, Mboamaji, and Tuliani; he states he may have customs-houses between Mboamaji and Kisiju, but he does not know of them and he does not know of any person at Dar es Salaam who would give this information.</p>
<p>He had visited Magogoni and Tuliani, but he has not been to Mboamaji. He does not know if there is a customs-house at Msasani; he says perhaps there are customs-houses there but these two places belong to Bagamoyo.</p>
<p>Ivory comes in greater abundance to Dar es Salaam than to these other places, which, however, on the other hand receive more merchandise, but he says the result is pretty well the same for all the customs houses.”<sup id="fnref:55"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:55">58</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>The future of Dar es Salaam had, however, been settled long before the Commission began its work. In August, 1885, a German naval squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Knorr proceeded to Zanzibar to obtain a commercial treaty from the Sultan and also recognition by him of the protectorates which the German Emperor claimed over certain territories in the interior of Africa by virtue of a number of treaties which Carl Peter and certain other Germans professed to have made with the local rulers. With six German warships anchored in front of his palace at Zanzibar Seyyid Barghash had no choice in the matter and perforce yielded with the best grace he could. This was followed by a letter from Admiral Knorr to the Sultan asking for the use of Dar es Salaam as a German naval base “from the friendship of Your Highness on behalf of my Government.” ‘Once again, Seyyid Barghash could not choose but hear and made the best of the situation by offering to place at the disposal of the German Government the buildings and space necessary for the navy’s purposes on shore<sup id="fnref:56"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:56">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A photograph of Dar es Salaam, which was taken by a German photographer from the harbour and which was reproduced in 1894 in Stuhlmann’s Mit Emin Pascha ins Herz von Afrika suggests that outwardly the place was much the same at that date as it was when Captain Sulivan took his photograph over twenty years before. Nevertheless, according to what Captain Leue tells us it was but a whited sepulchre when he landed there cn May 25 1887. “The place and its port were desolate...... All the streets were overgrown with grass and bush and the individual groups of houses were joined by native paths only.... In the halls of the Sultan’s palace lived bats, and castor oil plants were rampant in its walled garden. Part of the palace was used as a gaol.”<sup id="fnref:57"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:57">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As Elton wrote in 1874, “had the original plans of the founder, Seyyid Majid, been carried out in their full integrity, he would have left a model settlement behind him in the Mrima.”<sup id="fnref:58"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:58">49</a></sup>. It was no fault of the founder that those plans were never carried out in full. The idea showed that Majid. like his father Seyyid Said, was a man of considerable vision and, had his life been prolonged, his plans might have come much nearer to fruition than they did. History, however, proved that his plan, like that of the Mackinnon Road, was prematurely born, but neither his name nor those of the promoters of that later scheme should be entirely forgotten. Amid obstacles and difficulties, which it is hard for this modern age to appreciate, they made their contribution to the advancement of the prosperity and well being of the peoples of Tanganyika.</p>
