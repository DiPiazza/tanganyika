<p>In presenting this paper I hope to show, to those who have more than a passing interest in birds, that there is a greatly increased interest in them and value in their observations, if they relate the individual bird to the environment in which it has been seen. It is not the mere fact of knowing the bird which is the attraction of ornithology, but of learning something of the bird’s biological background. Moreover, a knowledge of the environment in which certain birds are to be found is an aid to their identification, or conversely when entering a certain type of country one knows which birds to look for, and those which are unlikely to be found there. A record of a bird not normally found in a certain habitat then becomes of considerable interest. For instance, in January 1943, Hugh F. Elliott and I were studying birds on the new Meserani dam in Masaiand and identified and collected a Terek Sandpiper (Terekia cinerea). That species, a Palaearctic migrant, had never before been noted in East Africa away from the coast, and was so unlike the birds we expected to see that it immediately drew our attention. As an observer’s knowledge of the distribution of East African birds grows, he becomes more and more on the lookout for birds which have been recorded elsewhere in East Africa but which may not have been found in his own district. Here again a knowledge of the habitat of these birds is an aid to knowing where to look for them.</p>
<p>The detailed background of this paper is largely limited to the Northern, Eastern, and Central Provinces with which I have been familiar for more than 18 years, but much is also drawn from the extensive and detailed studies made by R. E. Moreau (see bibliography) in the distribution of
birds in Tanganyika Territory, especially that of forest birds. The principles underlying the study of ecology naturally have a world wide application and the bird-plant communities discussed can be found all over the Territory, although somewhat modified specifically according to their
geographical position.</p>
<p>Ecology may be defined as “the study of an organism as a whole in relation to its environment”<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The environment will be a synthesis of various factors, climate, soil, geography, altitude, all of which condition the composition of the vegetation, which in turn generally determines the
incidence of the fauna. A study of plants shows that certain species will be found grouped together in “associations”. The commonest plant in an association is known as a “dominant’ and gives its name to the association.</p>
<p>A well known association in Tanganyika is the “miombo” woodland in which trees of species of Brachystegia and Isoberlinia sp. are either individually or co-dominant. Another is the much closer bushy woodland of the Moshi area, where Combretum spp. are dominant. Plant associations do not, however, always cover extensive areas, and one may give place to another in a comparatively small area, or islands of one may be found in a large area of another. One may instance here the occurrence of patches of coastal thicket which are found in large areas of poor shrubby grassland on the coast, although some of these may be the remains of large areas which have been cleared in the course of time by the local cultivators.</p>
<p>Superimposed on the plant communities are the insect, reptile, bird and animal communities, all inter-related through such factors as food requirements, climate, and altitude.</p>
<p>Thus certain species of sandplover and sandpipers are found only on the seashore or lake edge, snipe whether in Europe or on migration in Africa are largely confined to marshy areas, because of their food requirements, the Ashy Starling, Vulturine Guinea-fowl, and Tit-babbler are characteristic of dry semi-arid areas while Johnston’s Sunbird, the Mountain Chat and Golden-crowned Canary, are only found at higher altitudes. But how far each of the factors mentioned affects their distribution we do not know, nor whether still other factors are operative.</p>
<p>In this paper the particular relationship between birds and their environment will be described mainly on a bird-plant community basis. but it should not be inferred that those two groups form isolated associations which can be analysed without reference to the other groups of the
animal kingdom. For instance, while some birds are almost wholly fruit eating, large groups are insect eaters. Moreover birds themselves prey on other birds and are themselves preyed on by reptiles and various animals.</p>
<p>The study of bird-ecology in Africa is a comparatively recent development. Chapin<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, working in the Congo, studied bird distribution from an ecological viewpoint. He has been so ably followed by Moreau, in Tanganyika, whose studies of bird distribution in the Territory were at all times based on ecological criteria. But Moreau<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, after discussing the several factors potentially affecting bird distribution, admits himself at a loss to give a rational explanation of it. He says, “if I were called upon to declare my convictions in the matter, I could only say that temperature and humidity have a lot to do with it, but I cannot decide how; that vegetational
formation, itself largely dependent on geo-morphology as well as on both temperature and humidity, is a prime indicator and prime determinate of the bird population in any particular spot, but that vegetational composition within the formation is far less important’. Until much more is
known of the climate of large areas of Africa, and the local variations in what Moreau terms the standard climate of a given habitat, and until more is known of the biology of certain birds typical of various habitats, one is compelled, in describing the distribution of the birds of the Territory, to
relate them to the vegetative formations in which they are found.</p>
<p>The following factors may all have bearing on the distribution of birds.
(a) The presence or absence of suitable food and nesting sites.
(b) Climatic factors, humidity, light, temperature, pressure, wind.
(c) Vegetation.
(d) The eco-climate (Moreau)<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of suitable nesting sites must obviously condition the distribution of some birds, such as the Giant Hornbills (Bycanistes cristatus and bucinator) which nest in holes in trees Trees large enough to contain suitable nest holes are practically only to be found in
evergreen forest, which is the habitat of those species. But the lesser hornbills also nest in holes in trees, but do not enter evergreen forest for that purpose. Birds relying on tall upright grass for the support of their nests, such as the Bishop birds (Euplectes spp.) will be absent from short grass areas. Eut tne last species is noticeably absent from tall grass country immediately around Moshi, although the grasses appear ideal for its purpose. And consider the number of birds for which there are apparently adequate Se sites and materials in evergreen forest and woodland but which “e to be found only in the one and not the other habitat. Moreau [^8] gave his opinion that of hardly one-tenth of the birds known to him in Usambara could it be said that the observed limits of distribution were conditioned by this factor. Nor, with the exception of water birds, does the food factor appear to play any large part in determining the distribution. Moreau<sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> instances the fruit-eating Olive Pigeon (Columba arquatrix) which is common in the Usambara Highlands evergreen forest, but is almost unknown from the intermediate forest, although that is equally well supplied with fruit. On the other hand, at certain times of the year, there is considerable daily movement by some species from their true habitat, in searck of food elsewhere. The forest Hornbill (Bucanistes eristatus), and two forest starlings Onychognathus walleri and Stilbopsar kenricki all visit lowland areas when certain trees, particularly figs, are in
fruit. The many insectivourous birds which are confined to certain habitats, although others appear equally well supplied with insect life. further support that opinion. But Moreau<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> has shown that the distribution of the Vulturine Fish-Eagle (Gypohierax angolensis) a common West African species—is closely correlated with the occurrence of the Oil Palm, which appears to provide an important part of its food. This is well shown by the small colony of these birds at Sanje, in Ulanga District, where there are some forty-odd oil palms, which I believe is the only large group of this tree in the Kilosa, Morogoro or Ulanga Districts.</p>
<p>Climatic factors, as mentioned above, do appear to have something to do with bird distribution, but vegetation is so closely correlated with climate that it is impossible. at the present stage, to decide which factors are dominant. Humidity, a resultant of rainfall and temyerature, is Ww Iss
important in deciding the botany of the habitat. Both Chapin and Moreau agree that boundaries of bird communities are sharply defined by the boundaries of different vegetation formations, although Moreau<sup id="fnref3:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> does not believe that this holds good for the changes in “habit’ – the different plant association within a formation, particularly within evergreen forest. Of 294 species of land birds from Usambara, Moreau<sup id="fnref4:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> lists only 20 which are encountered both in evergreen forest and outside it. Moreover, in Usambara, where there are regenerating clearings in evergreen forest, no colonisation by forest birds occurs until “the small tree stage in the succession is reached, and then usually only by those species which inhabit the edges of evergreen forest. The same forest birds are, however, found in very dissimilar types of forest, whether humid or semi-humid, lowland or highland and in those forests maintain the same stratifications—e.g. ground birds inhabit that stratum in all types of forest, birds of the canopy are always tree-top birds.</p>
<p>The distribution of some of the genus Cisticola (Grass Warblers) apparently most markedly follows botanical formations. Cisticola cheniana is rarely found outside thorny woodland, or scattered bush and high grassland. <em>Cisticola juncidis</em> avoids scattered tree-grassland and shows marked preference for short grass plains whereas another small Cisticola C. brachyptera, appears to need a woodland, or at least a scattered tree-grassland habitat and is not found in the open plains.</p>
<p>There is also a sharp difference between the birds of semi-arid bush-land or scattered-tree grassland, and those of the semi-humid long grass woodland, which will be referred to more fully later. It may be remarked here that the apparently austere habitat of semi-arid scatiered-tree grassland contains a greater number of bird species than any type of habitat known to me.</p>
<p>Temperature itself may play some part in influencing breeding urges, and therefore influence the range of some birds. But as Moreau<sup id="fnref2:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> has shown, in any given habitat there may be considerable differences in temperature near the ground, in dense grass or in tree tops, in the-depihs of forest and outside, all different from the standard temperature as measured on a screen. This will be referred to again under eco-climate.</p>
<p>Moreau<sup id="fnref5:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> found very definite altitudinal zoning of birds in the Usambara, most marked above 5,000. Of 88 forest forms only 11 appear to exist in any number throughout the Lowland, Intermediate and Highland forests.* The other 77 snow very defined range, 16 being confined to
the Lowland forest. 21 species occur in the Lowland and Intermediate zones and 29 in the Intermediate and Highland zones only. In Usambara of the 200 spp. of non-forest birds only 16 do not occur in the lowland area, 7 of which are exclusively Highland and 9 confined to the Intermediate and Highland zones. The altitudinal limit is very well marked in some of these
birds, particularly the Golden and Malachite Sunbirds (Drepanonlectes reichenowi and Nectarinia famosa), which never occur below 5,000’, an observation which holds good for both on Meru, and in the case of the latter in the Uvidunda Mountains of Kilosa. The discontinuous range of some non-forest birds which occur both above and below the forest is also noted. But while the temperature changes with altitude, the difference between the mean maximum in Usambara for the hot and cold seasons is such that if birds show preferences for certain temperatures there would be well marked seasonal movements up and down the mountains. These do not take place and Moreau considers that it becomes unlikely that a direct reaction of birds to temperature is a general factor in controlling distribution locally.</p>
<p>Light, pressure—a function of altitude—and wind are all factors which may play some part in controlling distribution, and light may be of some importance in relation to forest birds. Moreau<sup id="fnref3:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> states that the light intensity at ground level in evergreen forest is 1/1,000 of that of the open air, and he suggests that birds which inhabit the gloom of the forest floor may be physically incapable of withstanding full sunlight. Outside, the forest biome light probably plays no part in distribution and Moreau considers it unlikely that pressure and wind play much part. Except within the forests most of Tanganyika is swept by strong winds towards the end of the dry season, to which all types of habitat, except the forest depths, are liable. These winds are more marked in open grass plains or scattered tree grasslands, but the botanical factor has already become operative and the differences in bird population are more probably due to botanical differences than to wind.</p>
<p>One other factor should be mentioned before specific bird-plant communities are described. The climate within a patch of tall grass is very different from that on bare rocks nearby, and both differ from the standard climate of the surrounding open air. Those specialised climates, related to their environment, are referred to by Moreau and other workers as eco-climates. Thus all the members of a bird community in semi-arid thorn bush are not actually subjected to the same climate. Moreau<sup id="fnref4:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> instances the case of a lark working the ground by day, which is exposed to a higher air temperature than a Kappoc-tit on a twig 6’ above, a difference which on data from temperate regions, is equivalent to the difference involved in more than 5,000’ in altitude. Generally the eco-climates within dense herbage or in woodland and near the ground are more extreme than the standard, whereas in forest under a canopy the daily maxima are generally lower than the standard climate. It is only reasonable to suppose that, when such eco-climatic differences can occur in adjacent habitats, eco-climate must play some part in a bird’s choice of habitat.</p>
<p>As will be appreciated from the preceding paragraphs, too little is known of the force of each factor in deciding a bird’s choice of habitat. so that in the present state of knowledge of bird distribution one is forced to use, almost entirely, the vegetational factor to provide the compartments for our bird associations. Altitude is also of some importance, forming, as
it were, first floor and attic rooms in the distribution, and is chiefly noticeable about 4,500’. In using the term “compartments” and “rooms”, I do not wish it to be thought that the bird-vegetation associations are sharply demarcated; several species are common to many vegetational formations, and are to be found at widely different altitudes. The terms do, however, give the broad impression of the intentions of this paper, to show briefly
the most important birds to be found in the chief vegetational formations of a large part of the Territory.</p>
<p>In order to keep the description of the habitats as simple and easily recognisable as possible, I may have outraged some botanical opinion by broadly lumping habitats of rather different dominant species. It has also led to artificial grouping of some birds from similar types of habitat from north, east and south which would not be found together, although the majority occur in those habitats throughout the greater part of the Territory.</p>
<h2 id="bibliography">BIBLIOGRAPHY<a class="headerlink" href="#bibliography" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>* In Usambara Moreau recognises Lowland evergreen forest with an upper limit of 2,500’; Intermediate from 2,500'—4,500' and Highland above 4,500’.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-the-keys">Use of the Keys.<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-the-keys" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I have tried to pick out the features which strike one in the field, such as a bright colour, or noticeable white mark or streaking. Males of several of the birds mentioned have striking breeding plumage and very nondes-cript off-season plumage, similar to the female. This is particularly so with such birds as the Bishops, and some of the Whydahs. It would be impossi-
ble to give an adequate field key for the off-season dress, and I have not attempted it.</p>
<p>Observers should concentrate on the characteristic colour of the bird, and if it is a brown or rather drab bird on any peculiarities in length of bill, legs or tail, and the proportion of white, if any, on the underparts. The sizes of the smaller birds should be related as far as possible to sparrows and thrushes. Larger birds generally have either reasonably distinct col-
ours or other characteristics. These sizes have again been divided generally into distinctly smaller than sparrows, sparrow size and thrush size, and large and very large birds.</p>
<p>For an example, take a bird seen on the seashore with long legs, plain brown upperparts, with white collar at back of neck and white forehead and a short bill, and plain white underparts. Looking at the leg the main divisions 1, 2, 3 and 4 are not applicable: division 5 contains birds with long legs and brown plumage: next look at the capital letters A.B. A is discarded as the bird is small: B fits. Then follow the small letters without suffixed number; a includes birds with short bills; a1 does not fit but b! does. Now follow letters with suffixes 2; a2 refers to birds with white
foreheads. Then follow letters with suffix 3; a3 refers to birds with no white collar on the neck and does not fit; b3 covers the observed bird which had no black on the back of the neck, and fits the White-fronted Sand Plover.</p>
<p>No field keys of the sort attempted here can ever be completely satisfactory, but it is hoped that used in conjunction with such a book as Roberts’s “Birds of South Africa”, they will assist in the identification of a large proportion of the birds seen.</p>
<h3 id="i-birds-of-the-seashore">I. BIRDS OF THE SEASHORE.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-birds-of-the-seashore" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Where the coast lies open to the Indian Ocean the receding tide generally leaves great areas of mud and sand-flats which are particularly attractive to the many migrant sandplovers and sandpipers from the Northern hemisphere. African forms of those families also occur. These are commonly known as waders and have characteristically long legs in relation to their general size. In creeks and inlets muddier conditions generally prevail, a smaller area is uncovered by the tide, and mangroves make their appearance. At high tide, when there is only a narrow strip
of dry sand between the water and the first vegetation, very few waders are to be seen on the shore. As the tide rises flocks fly to larger, undisturbed areas of the beach, or inland a short distance to low-lying marshy land. Salt pans are a favourite haunt at high tide.</p>
<p>Members of the sandpiper family feed on a mixed diet including insects, small mollusca and crustacea, fish fry and occasionally vegetable matter, and are commonly seen dibbing and probing the sand with their long bills. Many of these are not restricted to the seashore but are found on lake shores and along large rivers with suitable open beaches. There
is a certain amount of differentiation in the area chosen for feeding, some species such as the Little Stint, Sanderling and Ringed Plover keeping very near the water’s edge, while the White-fronted and Kittlitz Sand-plovers, the Three-ringed Plover and others seem to prefer the mudflats uncovered by the tide. The larger waders such as the Curlews, Oystercatchers and Whimbrels are more usually seen away from the water’s edge, but at very low tides are sometimes found in the water. A species which is a great paddler, as well as being a somewhat uncommon, odd-looking bird, is the Crab-Plover, which may be seen in small flocks opposite the golf course at Dar es Salaam and on the beaches at Mjimwema. This long-legged species happily paddles in fairly calm water well over its ‘knees’.</p>
<p>At low tide the waders are frequently joined by resting terns, gulls and sometimes by berons and egrets, although most of the last are more particularly birds of riverine, lake and swamp habitats. Kingfishers, particularly the Pied Kingfisher, fish from the posts of fish-traps at high tide, but are more particularly birds of the inlets and estuaries.</p>
<p>Large reefs, exposed at low tide, both inshore and more distant, attract a great variety of birds. This is the favourite hunting ground for most of the waders, which scatter themselves all over the pool-studded surface. Herons and egrets fish in the pools, while the Pied Kingfisher hovers over the larger ones. Terns rest near the water’s edge, occasionally springing into the air to give one of their masterly exhibitons of massed, unified flight, with sudden coordinated swings and swoops.</p>
<p>In harbours the most noticeable birds are kites and gulls which spend their time scavenging round ships. I have yet to see the Fishing Owl although it has been recorded from further north.</p>
<p>The mangrove areas are not particularly rich in bird life except for the Mangrove Kingfisher, and sometimes attracting herons, egrets and cormorants. Bee-eaters may sometimes hawk insects from the mangroves, but they are ubiquitous and cannot be considered a typical component of
the shore community. Where a few trees occur, and then only near an estuary, the uncommon Osprey may sometimes be found, as well as the resident Fish Eagle.</p>
<p>The following list of birds has been recorded from the Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Malindi beaches. All those from Malindi should occur round Dar es Salaam. Migrants, generally only seen from November to March, are marked M.</p>

The Sandpipers and Sand-Plovers are another matter and a Satisfactory field key is almost an impossibility. Relative sizes are an important aid in identifying these birds and that is impossible to convey adequately by the words larger and smaller. The following field notes may
help a little in deciding the bird’s identity.</p>
<p>Hemprich’s Gull is the only really common gull of the coast, and all the gulls seen in the harbours are almost certain to be this species. The Black-backed is much more rarely seen, although a small flock used to congregate at low tide on the sandspit at the mouth of the Msimbazi river near Selander Bridge, Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>The Terns are almost invariably seen in flocks, sometimes in harbours, more generally in the open sea, and at lew tide congregated on reefs. Their pale grey plumage, forked tails and long bills are characteristic. The species are not easy to distinguish without considerable familiarity with them. To confuse identification other species not listed may be present on rare occasions. In breeding plumage those known on the East African coast have black forehead, crown and nape with the exception of the Crested Tern, which has a white forehead.</p>
<p>The sand-plovers and sandpipers, Stint, Sanderling and Turnstone are mostly comparatively small birds, and many are seen chiefly in flocks. Long legs in relation to body size and short and long bills in relation to head size are important diagnostic cnaracters. Bill and feet colour is not
much aid to identification with cne cr two exceptions.</p>
<p>The Ringed and Three-ringed Sand-Plovers are most easily known and the yellow bill and orange legs of the first are distinct from the red bill and yellow legs of the second. These two birds are generally seen in ones and twos, as is the very distinctive Turnstone, with its mottled dark and light brown and white upperparts and black-brown bar across the chest. It is a bird which gives the impression of single-minded concentration on the job in hand when seen searching for food on the landward edge of a reef at low tide. Its black bill distinguishes it from the other ‘banded’ plovers.</p>
<p>The Mongolian Sand Dotterel, Kittlitz and White-fronted Sand-Plover are difficult to identify. They are sometimes seen in small parties, but more frequently in ones and twos. They all have a distinct white forehead, and Kittlitz Sand-Plover is more easily distinguished with its black
edge to the white collar on the back of the neck. The Mongolian Sand Dotterel gives the appearance of standing higher on its legs; it does not have the white nuchal collar of the other two.</p>
<p>Of the Sandpiper family perhaps the Sanderling is most readily identified because of its pale plumage and the black at the point of shoulder of the wing. Sanderlings are generally seen in close flocks standing at the water’s edge. Terek’s Sandpiper is a rare visitor to Dar es Salaam but its upceurved bill and yellow feet are good diagnostic characters. A very common shorebird in small parties and singly is the Curlew Sandpiper, of rather insignificant appearance, but which can be easily told with a good sight of the bill, which is distinctly downcurved at the tip.</p>
