<h1 id="a-brief-review-of-archaeological-remains-in-tanganyika">A Brief Review of Archaeological Remains in Tanganyika<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-review-of-archaeological-remains-in-tanganyika" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h3 id="h-a-fosbrooke">H. A. Fosbrooke.<a class="headerlink" href="#h-a-fosbrooke" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Tanganyika is rich in archaeological remains and those already found in the small portion of the Territory which has been subjected to extensive archaeological investigation indicate that many more sites of great scientific value still await discovery. There is unfortunately as yet no compre-
hensive volume to which the enquirer can be referred comparable with publications dealing with adjacent territories, such as Dr. Leakey’s “Stone Age Cultures of Kenya,” Dr. Clark’s “Stone Age Cultures of Northern Rhodesia,” or Rev. Neville Jones’ ‘Prehistory of Southern Rhodesia.” This
paper will therefore attempt to summarize very briefly the present state of our knowledge of the known relics of Tanganyika’s past.</p>
<p>For the purpose of these notes man’s past can be broadly divided into three periods, the prehistoric, the protohistoric and the historic. By the first, the prehistoric, we mean that period concerning which there are no written or oral records available, by the protohistoric that period of which oral or traditional record is available, but nothing in writing, and by historic that period covered by the written record. It will of course be obvious from what follows that these broad divisions must to some extent overlap. At one and the same time there are written records available concerning events on the coast known to the Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries, traditions preserved during this period amongst some up-country tribes who have enjoyed some stability of culture for a considerable period, and nothing but the stone implements of other folk now lost who were co-existing at ‘the same time with a culture still at the stone age level.</p>
<p>Prehistoric man has left evidence of his presence in three forms; his stone implements, his paintings and engravings on rock and his own skeletal remains. Tanganyika is fortunate in being able to provide at Olduvai 3 classic series of implements, showing the development of the tools used by Early Stone Age man from a locally chipped pebble to a well-formed
hand axe. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Early Stone Age was the time before man had yet discovered how to produce a cutting edge from flints, obsidian or other such hard materials. It is a sobering thought, and one which may help to get today’s problems into perspective, that this period of evolution occupied so many millenia that the Serengeti Plains were flooded to form a lake, desiccated
into steppeland with typical steppe fauna, were reflooded, and again dried out. This was before that area had assumed the topography familiar today caused by rifting and tectonic activity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The Middle Stone Age in Africa was that period of man’s development during which his implements were of a smaller type, formed by a different technique and of different material. There were blades with sharp cutting edges, points and scrapers formed of such materials as were available, flint in Europe, hard stone such as agate, quartzite and quartz in East Africa
generally, and, in the volcanic areas, that striking material, obsidian, which presents the appearance of black glass. Many such artifacts are found in the upper strata at Olduvai, in the neighbouring rock shelter of Apis (Nasera) Rock and in the form of surface finds throughout Northern Tanganyika.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The Late Stone Age is characterized not only by the implements of the Middle Stone Age described above. but also by stone bowls, occasional volished axes, a certain amount of crude pottery and beads made of chips of ostrich shell and other such material drilled through the middle. It is probable that certain tribes of Tanganyika were living at a Late Stone Age cultural level till very recently, in particular the Hadzapi or Tindiga recently described in Tanganyika Notes and Records.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The second form in which early man left his mark was that of rock paintings and engravings, and Tanganyika is particularly rich in the former. The Kondoa district is the main centre where over 100 painted sites are known. Every new visit by trained observers produces many more
finds and it is obvious that this store of prehistoric art is only now begin viing to be tapped.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>As distinct from the early art of Europe where pre-historic paintings usually occurred in caves, those of Tanganyika are found on the surface of rock shelters. These may be formed by the underside of boulders or groups of boulders in the form of kopjes or by slabs of rock protruding at an angle from the ground, or again by undercutting at the base of cliffs or escarpments. According to the degree of overhang, so varies the degree of protection from the elements. This means that no sealed caves comparable to those in Europe have been found to enable the paintings to be dated with any certainty, but when the world-famed expert M. l’Abbé Breuil
visited Tanganyika on the occasion of the Pan-African Congress on Pre-history in 1948, he pronounced the earliest paintings comparable in age with the oldest in Europe and South Africa.</p>
<p>The style of these paintings varies from naturalistic reproductions of game animals to fantastic reproductions of the human form. The main characteristics of these latter are the elongated nature of the body, the head-dresses, masks or hair styles which frequently obscure the shape of the head, and the arm and leg ornaments such as can be observed in, for instance, some dancing scenes. Crudely drawn animals are sometimes mistaken by the uninitiated for representations of extinct species, but expert examination has invariably revealed these to be examples of the desraded art forms practised by the immediate predecessors of the present-
day inhabitants during, probably, the last two or three centuries.</p>
<p>Another manifestation of this so-called “modern white” technique is found in the form of geometric design—circles, squares with dots, crosses, and a multiplicity of other formalized designs. No adequate explanation has yet been put forward of the meaning of these: nor are the artists known with any certainly, but as a working hypothesis it can be assumed that the
early styles of naturalistic animals and formalized design were the work of Stone Age artists, whilst the “modern whites” are those of the immigrant Rantu of recent centuries. It is hoped that the excavations which commenced in the 1951 season in some of the Kondoa shelters and which will proceed year by year will finally present us with a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>One of the highest manifestations of prehistoric art in South Africa is to be found in the form of engravings in rock, but of these very few examples are known in Tanganyika. Some instances of crudely hammered out animal forms of infantile conception are known but only one example
of anything moderately ancient has come to light, in the form of animal figures very reminiscent of the rock engravings of the Sahara and the Upper Nile area.</p>
<p>The third form in which man leaves traces of his past is that of his skeletal remains. So far few of these have come to light in Tanganyika, but those which have, have achieved considerable publicity in scientific circles. For many years controversy raged around the fossil cranium of a
man found by Professor Reck in the Olduvai Gorge in 1918. It was at first thought that here we might have a representative of the people responsible for the hand axe culture so richly represented at this site, but subsequent examination of the position by numerous experts has led to the conclusion that Olduvai man is of Middle and not Early Stone Age origin.<sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There is every reason to believe that Olduvai man was of the same species as that which inhabits the world today, i.e., Homo sapiens, but his neighbour, Eyassi man, who was found by Dr. Kohl Larsen at the north end of Lake Eyassi in 1936, belongs to a separate species, Paieanthropus njarasensis. <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. Again discovery of these remains was accompanied
by fantastic claims concerning their age, but the latest position is perhaps
best summarized by Wells, (1950) in the following quotation <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>:—</p>
<p>“Weidenreich (1943) has suggested that the fragmentary skull from Lake Eyassi in Tanganyika, formerly regarded as very primitive in character and compared with the Pekin and Java fossil men, is in reality intimately related to the Broken Hill skull. Such a relationship appears highly probable; it is indeed possible that the Broken Hill and Eyassi skulls belong essentially to the same type, but the Eyassi remains are too imperfect for the exact degree of relationship to be
established. It is noteworthy that Leakey (1946) considers the Eyassi skull to be associated with a Levalloisian culture roughly equivalent to the early stages of the Middle Stone Age in Northern Rhodesia.”</p>
<p>Thus of the Old Stone Age no representative has as yet come to light in Tanganyika. Of Middle Stone Age man we have two examples, one of human and one of allied species. Of Late Stone Age man skeletons have been found in the grave cairns of Ngorongoro, but these still await description in scientific literature. Numerous other burial cairns do occur throughout Northern Tanganyika but from only one of these has the skeleton been scientifically examined <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> and here there were no artifacts to enable an association to be made between this man and his culture.</p>
<p>So much, then, for the prehistoric remains, mostly many thousands of years old, of which naturally enough no tradition is extant. In the protohistoric sphere dealt with hereunder, some of the traditions are clear and credible, others mere vestiges from the dawn of tribal history which
cannot be accepted without corroborative evidence. In the last few centuries many races and tribes have moved across the East African stage, leaving only the vaguest of traces of their passage. Some of these are in the form of tribal remnants still existing amongst the better-known tribes of Tanganyika. Other traces of these early peoples are to be found in the
form of house sites, earthworks and other such remains, Whilst Tanganyika can offer nothing comparable with Zimbabwe or Khami, there exists at Engaruka at the base of the Rift wall between Lakes Natron and Manyara the remains of a large town, which Dr. Leakey esti-
mated must have contained a population of between 30 and 40 thousand <sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>. The remains to be seen today consist of the crumbiing stone walls of circular huts, cairns thought to be burial cairns hut having so far vielded no skeletal remains, and stone terraces and water courses. Some of these protohistoriec inhabitants must have been well versed in the improvement
and conservation of water supplies. In central Masailand there is a series of wells driven through crystalline limestone to a depth of up to 60 ft. Those illustrated in a recent number of Tanganyika Notes and Records<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> have jost all resemblance to their original form, having been converted into wide-mouthed apertures in the form of inverted truncated cones by the unskilled excavations of Chaga tribesmen employed by the Masai to “improve” these sources of water. But at Naberera, Makami and Ndedo subsequent excavation has been less radical, so the original form of the wells can be seen. The shaft is consistently narrow—only about 2’ 6” in diameter—and some have argued from this that the makers of these wells must either have
been very small people or have possessed some particular technique of well sinking. But this theory cannot be substantiated as the air shafts of the underground bolt holes referred to later are of even smaller diameter and yet we have evidence that they were dug by the tribes at present in the area who are neither small nor particularly skilled excavators.</p>
<p>Throughout and beyond Masailand there are to be found numerous earthworks in the form of dams. About three miles to the west of Ngorongoro camp there is a series of three dams in a drainage line coming from Oldeani mountain. The conservers of this water must have found that the lowest dam frequently failed to fill, possibly as the country desiccated in the course of one of the recent climatic fluctuations known to have occurred in East Africa. In consequence they cut a diversion ditch from a neighbouring water course to fill the bottom dam. The road from Ngorongoro camp to the Serengeti now passes over the middle dam and through the diversion
cut. In central Masailand and as far south as the area around Kongwa, which was cleared of bush for the Groundnut Scheme, depressions are to be found, which present every appearance of being artificially created to conserve surface water, but no excavations have been carried out, nor have any of the tools or weapons of the people concerned been found to suggest
who they might have been. There is however every reason to believe that they were a pastoral people practising a system of transhumance, i.e. using the grazing and rainwater on the plains during the rainy season and falling back on permanent water supplies in rivers and the wells referred to above in the dry season. So here again is evidence of moderately recent climatic change, for no one could have herded cattle in the thick deciduous thicket which was cleared in the course of the Groundnut Scheme: it must have been much more open grassland when these rain ponds were excavated.</p>
<p>Another type of protohistoric remains more accessible to the visitor is to be found in the Moshi and Pare districts <sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> &amp; <sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup>. These consist of elaborate underground earthworks in the form of passages and chambers wherein were hidden cattle and womenfolk in the time of tribal warfare. Contrary to popular belief it was not so much the pastoral Masai who were the cause of these elaborate anti-raid precautions as the neighbouring Bantu tribes, who seem to have spent much of their time and energy in raiding neighbours. A good example of such remains is to be seen within a few jundreds yards of the two hotels at Marangu, Moshi district. In this neigh-
bourhood also can be seen some interesting examples of the engraved rocks which are associated with the initiation ceremonies which the present inhabitants of the area, the Chaga, practised up to the beginning of this century.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup>:</p>
<p>Another type of protohistoric remains, namely, the stone-walled fort, is also exemplified in this area. These works were of dry-stone masonry. The art of creating lime mortar does not seem to have penetrated inland, though it had been practised on the coast for many centuries. Such forts seem to have been a later development in the practice of tribal warfare, and their form is doubtless due to Arab influence spread with the slave trade through much of Tanganyika. The Northern area was, however, icrtunate in suffering a minimum of hardship from this scourge.</p>
<p>Further stonework in the form of terraces is to be found in the Hehe area.<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, one particular type of rock painting which is termed the “modern white” is thought to be only two or three centuries old and to have been the work of the tribes who were the immediate predecessors of the present inhabitants of the area concerned. <sup id="fnref2:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> &amp; <sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup>. This phase of
prehistoric art is largely symbolic and where the representation of animals is attempted is crude in the extreme.</p>
<p>As explained above, the creation of many of these protohistoric remains must have been contemporary with or subsequent to events concerning which written records exist, so bringing them into the historic category. Readers of Tanganyika Notes and Records are particularly fortunate in having so indefatigable a contributor as Sir John Gray, whose articles
(18-23) shed such light on the history of the East African Coast. Many more tangible remains of this history exist than of the tribal ebb and flow of the hinterland. The abandoned city of Gedi and the massive pile of Fort Jesus at Mombasa, both in Kenya, are rivalled by the equally impressive but less publicized remains in Tanganyika. Numerous examples of these latter have however been described in Tanganyika Notes and Records <sup id="fnref2:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup>-<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">18</a></sup>, and more recently in a well-illustrated article in the East African Annual <sup id="fnref:29"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:29">19</a></sup>. In a relatively undeveloped country such as Tanganyika, many relics of prehistoric, protohistoric and historic times still doubtless
await discovery, whilst those that are known cannot be protected with the meticuluous care which is devoted to similar remains in richer and more advanced countries. So the assistance of the public is all the more necessary in preserving our heritage from the past.</p>
<p>Such assistance can be given in two ways, firstly by reporting any such discoveries to the Secretariat or the nearest District Office. When possible such reports will be investigated by an expert, and if the site is deemed worthy it will be “gazetted” and so given protection under the Monuments Preservation Ordinance, 1937. Thereafter excavation, tampering with, or
removing parts of such relics is forbidden except under licence. But by the very nature of this process there is bound to be a hiatus between the discovery of a valuable site and its protection.</p>
<p>So the second way in which the public can assist is by exercising restraint: by refraining from chipping or drawing round newly discovered rock paintings, from digging up and removing bones or stone implements from freshly revealed sites or from removing—a heinous but common crime—built-in bowls from ruined mosques and tombs. The satisfaction of having discovered, and preserved for posterity, some valuable relic is much greater than that to be gained from the surreptitious removal of souvenirs.</p>
