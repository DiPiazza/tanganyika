<h1 id="people-from-the-lake-victoria-region-from-a-lecture-given-to-the-lake-province-society">People from the Lake Victoria Region (From a lecture given to the Lake Province Society)<a class="headerlink" href="#people-from-the-lake-victoria-region-from-a-lecture-given-to-the-lake-province-society" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h3 id="h-cory">H. Cory<a class="headerlink" href="#h-cory" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Lake Province covers a land area of about 39,000 square miles and has a population of one million eight hundred thousand. As far as population is concerned it is by far the largest province in the territory. There are few records of what the country was like in pre-European days, but it seems clear that it was overgrown with bush, in some areas heavy and in some areas light. An early explorer wrote that the Sukuma drive their cattle into the <em>forest</em> during the dry season. It was everywhere sparsely populated. The scattered human colonies consisted of a hundred odd people under the leadership of an Ntemi, a name which only later became the title of a chief. <em>Kutema</em> means to cut down trees in the bush, and shows that the Batemi of this time were true pioneers who opened up the country and retained the leadership of their followers, who were mainly members of their own family.</p>
<p>The various settlements had little communication with each other and had no conception of tribal unity. The Batemi never thought of enlarging the areas under their influence except for the sake of increasing the huntingground for their people. But these men were not only hunters. Even at that time, before the arrival of the Hamitic invaders, the Bantu tilled their fields and drove their cattle to pasture. Hunting, however, was from all points of view an important activity. It was necessary to protect the fields in the bush against marauding game and to provide additional meat for the pot, and later to obtain ivory for trading.</p>
<p>It may be because of the isolation of the separate settlements that the form of marriage by abduction, traces of which can still be found here and there in the marriage customs, was widespread.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the Bantu, which is not of course the name of a certain race, but of a very big language group.,Now the Bantu are themselves immigrants and are amixed people. Sir Harry Johnston thinks that somewhereto the South of Lake Chad the indigenous people came into contact with Hamitic groups. The resultant mixed people migrated to the east and crossed over to the Elgon area, where, even now, live people who speak a very ancient dialect—Lugishu. From there they spread to the south and back to the east in the Lake region. These people are the Bantu.</p>
<p>Many theories have been advanced in support of the supposition that the Lake region was one of the first areas to be inhabited by the Bantu. Professor Warmelo, who tried to enlist the aid of linguistic science to help in the solution of ethnological problems, advanced the following theory: Words which are common to a great number of Bantu languages and dialects must be old, that is to say they have been used by people who were the ancestors of younger tribes. The meaning of such very old words should allow a conclusion to be made about the manner of life, about common animals and plants, about foodstuffs and implements and arts and crafts the word <em>Nyanja, Nyanza, Nyassa</em>—Lake—from which comes <em>Ngwa</em> with which the people were familiar. He drew attention to the fact that <em>Nyanza</em>—to the Lake—contracted to <em>Mwanza</em>, is found in many Bantu languages. It does not mean water or river—it means lake. Common to many languages also is the root <em>ato</em>, meaning canoe, and <em>kapi</em>, meaning paddle. The root <em>twa</em>, meaning pigmy is also widespread and shows that these Ur-Bantu knew the aboriginal inhabitants of Africa.</p>
<p>For reasons which we do not know, thousands of years ago people in the North of Africa began to emigrate to the south. The progress was slow and it is, for instance, said that the Masai arrived four to five hundred years ago at the Rift Valley.</p>
<p>These people were Hamites; their home the Gala area in Abyssinia. There is a theory that some of these nomadic cattle-breeders were forced into their southern journey by the gradual drying up of the Sahara desert at a certain period. This emigration brought the Bantu into contact with the Hamites a second time, and this is perhaps one of the most important features of their history because, as Professor Seligman states: “The history of Africa south of the Sahara is no more than the story of the permeation through the ages, in different degrees and at different times, of the negro and bushman aborigines by Hamitic blood and culture. The Hamites were, in fact, the great civilizing force of black Africa from a relatively early period.”</p>
<p>The entrance gate of the Lake Province for the Hamitic immigrants was Bukoba, and they probably arrived there about three hundred and fifty years ago. They were Bahima, also called Bahuma or Batusi. The ruling family in Bunyoro was of Hamitic origin and a scion of this dynasty enter- ed the Bukoba area with a group of followers. He was Ruhinda, one of those figures in African history who have become the source of many legends and who are not now thought of as mortals but enjoy the veneration given to deities, although they are not members of any celestial hierarchy. Ruhinda gave his name to the ruling class of Bukoba, the Bahinda. The Hinda invasion was in the main peaceful.</p>
<p>Ruhinda held sway over the south-west and south coast of Lake Victoria as far as Smith Sound. There is 4 legend that at the time of his death Thangiro and Uzinza both wanted to bury him in their country, and each side pulled so hard at the body that it broke in half and each half was buried in the country of the party gaining it. Another legend has it that his body was cut up into five pieces and one piece was buried in each of his five dominions as a solution of the dispute between them about the place of burial. The head was taken to Karagwe, the two arms to Kiziba, one leg to Kiamtwara and the other to Ihangiro. The trunk was buried in Uzinza on the Lake shore in Ruhinda’s village of Kimwani.</p>
<p>There is an uninterrupted line of descent of the Bukoba chiefs from Ruhinda to the present day. Kiziba has its own history of origin; it is, however, connected with the Hinda family. The Bahinda are now a very big family and many of its members are just common peasants.</p>
<p>Biharamulo is a big district and the area is characteristic of many parts of Africa. Ample spaces, totally undeveloped, scarcely populated and infested with <em>glossina</em> of all kinds, which means sleeping sickness and rinderpest. For this reason the population is assembled in “concentrations.” The inhabitants represent a connecting link between the Lacustrians, the tribes living between the Lakes, and the Rundi group of tribes. Their ruling dynasty is of Hima origin. When the Germans arrived in that part of the country in about 1889 they found there Kasasura—a very powerful chief who made such an impression on Count Götzen, a German officer, that the latter recommended the building of a strong fortification, which still stands, the walls now tending to lean perilously outward. Each D.C. in succession now leaves as monument to his period of office one or more buttresses to reinforce the tottering glory of the past.</p>
<p>In Bugufi live the Bahangaza, who are Barundi, as likewise are the inhabitants of Busubi, the second chiefdom comprising the district of Ngara. The rulers’ family came from Urundi and is of Hima or Tusi stock.</p>
<p>The Bahangaza are ethnographically so completely Barundi that a Rundi chief recently though fit to claim Bagufi as part of his country. The claim was laid before the United Nations, who decided to investigate it. The people of Bugufi unanimously, and in an impressive form, gave it to be understood that they would never agree to change British Administration for Belgian. As even on historical grounds the claim was very shaky, the final decision in this matter followed the will of the people. The Bahangaza are a very quiet people, not many of them literate, and their standard of living is low. Their main income comes from labouring in Uganda, whither every year a considerable percent of the male population migrates. But when it came to the vital question of which European power should be in charge they realized the importance of the issue and became articulate and firm.</p>
<p>Passing back through Biharamulo and rounding the Emin Pasha Gulf, we enter Uzinza. Emin Pasha was, as is generally known, an Austrian at one time in the service of the German Government, and sent to occupy this country He was for a time resident at Bukoba and he was responsible for making it possible for everyone to grow coffee. He laid out a big coffee nursery near Bukoba and he distributed the young plants among cultivators. The planting of coffee had been for centuries the prerogative of the chiefs, who gave away seedlings, rather as medals are given, to deserving favourites.</p>
<p>Coffee is indigenous to Africa and has been known since very ancient times, not as a beverage but as a very sustaining food. The Gala and others took with them on their raids balls made of raw ground coffee mixed with ghee as iron rations. It is said that a ball the size of a billiard ball could sustain a man for a day. Because of its use, raids on distant tribes depended on the possession of coffee, and so leaders, and later the Bukoba chiefs, reckoned coffee to be part of their armaments.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Bazinza are related to the Bahaya, were under Hinda rule, and colonized only the shore area of the Lake. The hinterland did not interest them. It is now of great interest to the Sukuma Federation, to which the Zinza chiefdoms belong, and about which I will soon have more to say.</p>
<p>We next cross Smith Sound, which is presumed to have been named after a certain Lieutenant Shergold Smith, the leader of a missionary expedition to the Lake area in 1877. During this expedition Lieutenant Smith carried out a survey of the Sound on which Mwanza is built. He was subsequently murdered on Ukerewe Island by the men of Chief Lakonge, the ruler of that area.</p>
<p>From Smith Sound we enter Sukumaland proper. I recently read an cold book. “New Light on Dark Africa,” in which the author, Karl Peters, writes: “The Basukuma exhibit the characteristics of the dwellers in marshy plains. They are heavy and sleepy, but, as it appears, reliable and steady.” I think that this is not a bad judgment, especially as I feel that they have woken up since then.</p>
<p>Along the same road on which I have brought you from Uzinza to Usukuma came the Hima, whose descendants now rule over the greater number of the Sukuma chiefdoms. While the group of Lacustrians living north and west of Lake Victoria has for many hundred years formed and retained a number of kingdoms, the best known being Buganda, Bunyoro and Karagwe the group living south of Lake Victoria has never built up an empire. But the immigrants from the north, mainly from Bunyoro, being well acquainted with the idea of powerful and extensive kingdoms, fundamentally influenced the political structure of the area. The immigrating families established authority over sections of the existing population and came to rule over them. The Hamitic element has been wholly absorbed, however, and only faint traditions remain to tell of the historical events of the invasion.</p>
<p>There is no strict conception of a common tribal name for the people living in the area from Shinyanga to Lake Victoria and between Smith Sound and the Mbalangeti river. The Word “Sukuma,” now generally used as a tribal name for the inhabitants, in their own language means “north.” The Basukuma, together with the Nyamwezi-speaking peoples living south of Usukuma, comprise the Sukuma-Nyamwezi language group which has in common not only language but also many other ethnic characteristics. Travellers passing through Nyamwezi countries were probably informed about the country of “sukuma’”—the country to the north—and so the name came to be generally adopted. The Basukuma of the Lake area proper call themselves Bagwe and their language Kigwe, but this name is not used frequently and some people say that it has been given to them by their neighbours.</p>
<p>As a result of the non-existence of a common tribal name the subjects or the Sukuma chiefdoms adopted the clan names of their rulers as their specific tribal names. The most important among the immigrating families of Hamitic origin were the Bazinza, Basiha, Bakwimba, Bagero and Basega. Many contradictory stories exist about their early history, their adventurous travels and their conquest of Sukumaland. Almost every Sukuma chiefdom has its own tradition which tends to increase the importance of the first arrivals and to compete thus with chiefdoms ruled by other branch lines of the same family. Generally it can be stated that the leading members of these families were not military conquerors. They did not arrive with numerous followers and they were obviously accepted as leaders by common consent, as no major fights are related as occurring between them and the people they found living in the country. It seems that, at the very time of their arrival, the country, which had been originally very sparsely populated, became sufficiently consolidated to make a common leadership for groups of isolated settlements desirable. These immigrants offered many advantages as leaders. They were ideal judges because they were totally unbiased, as they belonged to none of the local clans. For the same reason they were also the best arbitrators for a just distribution of the spoils of the chase and of clan warfare. They may also have impressed the indigenous population with superior mental and physical qualities.</p>
<p>It may be that a large part of Usukuma has had a comparatively peaceful history. Although inter-tribal wars were frequent, they were not very bloody and sometimes a few accidents, not necessarily connected with warfare, sufficed to bring the battle to an end. From outside there was little menace, and therefore you see in north and middle Usukuma a type of scattered settlement most convenient for the peasant, with his fields close to his hut, whereas, in the south, raids by the Masai and more serious inter-tribal wars menaced the people, who reacted by living in close settlements.</p>
<p>As a result of the favourable conditions of a comparatively dense and widespread population, many indigenous institutions can be found here. Hardly anywhere else are the religious features of ancestor worship so elaborate as they are in Sukumaland. It is not so much the rites which are exceptionally elaborate. As far as these are concerned other tribes have created more impressive ceremonies. It is the actual organisation of the religious cult which is a special Sukuma achievement. We have here two societies, Bafumu and Bumanga, to one or both of which almost every Sukuma belongs. Their sole purpose is to regulate the features of the cult of ancestor worship, the basic religious beliefs of the Sukuma, and, for that matter, of all Bantu. For instance, novices are instructed as to what medium for soothsaying is preferable to any other. It is a common feature that magic and medical knowledge are closely connected with the religious aspect of life.</p>
<p>Besides the Bafumu and Bumanga, concerned with ancestor worship and soothsaying, since ancient times secret societies of snake-charmers, porcupine-hunters, and elephant-hunters have thrived in this area. Although “he origin of these is not always found in Sukumaland or in Unyamwezi, they were able to form their biggest organisations and most lively inter-society connections here.</p>
<p>Since the Banyamwezi, who are so closely related to the Basukuma, were the first to be employed as porters on the great Bagamoyo—Tabora—Ujiji trade route, the Basukuma were called, and called themselves until recent times, Banyamwezi as soon as they left their own country. They have been and still are very good workers. They made contact with very many other tribes. When European agricultural enterprises were started they became a very valued labour force in the camps. Today groups of them are frequently found near the big estates, living on their own land and still working for the Europeans. Sometimes they have become detribalized and supply the markets with the produce of their fields. Everywhere one or another member of the Sukuma tribal group has preserved the manifold knowledge of his fathers and practices a little medicine here and a little magic there, or is popular as a diviner.</p>
<p>Before we come to Musoma, I must mention the Ukerewe or Bukerewe Island, as it really should be called. It is inhabited by a mixture of tribes. The island is thickly populated by roughly equal proportions of Bakerewe, Bakara (who have their own island a few miles to the north) and Bajita who also inhabit an overcrowded chiefdom on the mainland just inside the Musoma District. All three tribes have a tradition of having come at a not very distant date from Bukoba District, and there is every reason to believe this to be true. The three languages are so similar to the Luhaya tongue that the people of Ukerewe have little difficulty in understanding the speech of the Bukoba natives. The chiefs are Bahinda.</p>
<p>The island of Ukara is about eight miles north of Ukerewe. The people immigrated there from Bukoba, where the inhabitants of the chiefdom of Maruku are still known as Bakara, though the smartly dressed young men from Maruku deny relationship with the sack-clothed Bakara dock laborers on the wharf at Mwanza.</p>
<p>In the Musoma District live the Bajita, already mentioned, the Ikizu Shashi, Zanaki, Ikoma and Nguruimi. All these tribes have a dash of Hamitic or Nilotic blood in them. The Hamitic Taturu (other names for these people are Tatoga and Wamangati) were numerous in this area. Baumann, from whom the Baumann Gulf takes its name, and who was the leader of an expedition in 1896 or thereabouts, found them still near the Lake shores, whence they have now completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The broad Mara river divides the Musoma District from the North Mara District. In the latter live the Luo and Girango who are Nilotic, the Kuria who are of Bantu-Nilo-Hamitic origin and the Suba who are ethnologically between the two.</p>
<p>The Kuria are Masai who emigrated into their present habitat about eleven generations ago. They settled down—for reasons unknown—to a peasant life, giving up the nomadic habits of their forefathers. They retained some of the Masai spirit—the love of cattle and great zeal in acquiring them, and an independent character.</p>
<p>Before I leave the African population of the Lake Province I would like to say a few words about the original social structure. From the west to the east the authority of chiefs diminishes, from absolutism in Bukoba through a milder form of absolutism slightly controlled by democratic institutions in Sukumaland, to the substitution of councils of elders for chiefs among the Kuria.</p>
<p>Now we come to the more recent history of this big area, which is fairly well known because many of the first European explorers passed through one part or another of the Lake Province. Speke discovered the Lake in 1858 during his famous expedition with Burton. Stanley passed several times through this region and had trouble with the inhabitants of Bumbiri Island, on the Bukoba coast, of which no tradition whatever could be found by later explorers! Speke and Grant, on another expedition, passed through Karagwe on their journey to Mutesa, the notorious Kabaka of Uganda, and lived “for several months at Rumanika’s court. Dr. Junker, the famous Russian explorer spent six days in Msalala in 1886. A German lieutenant, Kollmann, wrote the first monograph about this part of the Lake and the inhabitants of its shores in 1899. The book is called “Victoria Nyanza.” Another old book is that of H. Rehse, a German Sergeant-Major. It is called “Kiziba” and the co-author of it was Mwami Lwamgira, the notable Mhaya.</p>
<p>The first Church Missionary Society station to be opened in this area was at Buzilima at the south end of Smith Sound. The history of the Church Missionary Society relates how in November, 1882, the Reverend E. C. Gordon, Mr. C. Wise and others reached Buzilima. The old chief, Chasama, who only died recently, had very interesting stories to tell of the arrival of these early missionaries. Most of the party pushed on to Uganda, but Gordon and Wise remained and started to build the mission station. The famous Missionary, A. M. Mackay, joined them in 1887 and a new station was built twelve miles to the north of the old one, the hostile attitude of the chief and various inhabitants having made the station at Buzilima intolerable. The short life of this Mission station came to an end in 1890 with the death of Mackay. The work was continued at other stations, including Nassa, but the Busambiro station was abandoned and has never keen revived. The graves of Mackay, Parker, Blackburn, Hunt and Dunn, who all died there during this brief period, can still be seen near the ruins of the Mission. The work of the Church Missionary Society in the Sukuma area was taken over by the Africa Inland Mission in 1909.</p>
<p>The White Fathers Mission started from Zanzibar via Bagamoyo, and the first caravan arrived at the Lake in 1876, the ultimate goal of the safari being Buganda. There they settled first and from there in 1882 they returned to the southern shores of the Lake. They did not leave Buganda voluntarily, but had to escape because of the persecutions of Kabaka Mutesa.</p>
<p>They selected Bukumbi in the Smith Sound area as a suitable spot for a mission station. Shortly afterwards they opened up a second station in Nyegezi. This later station was, however, soon closed down. It was situated on the Lake shore and proved unhealthy. The present Nyegezi Missionwas built in 1929 and 1930. From Bukumbi the White Fathers went to Ukerewe in 1895, and during the next decade to Bukoba and many other places in the Lake Province.</p>
<p>The name Bukumbi, meaning “the place of beads,” was not, as many people think, derived from the rosaries worn by the White Fathers. It was so named because a pot of beads was unearthed there long before the arrivalof the White Fathers.</p>
<p>Less peaceful was the entrance of the White Fathers into Bukerewe, where the boat with missionaries was received with a hail of poisoned arrows. They had to retreat, but finally they succeeded in coming ashore at another spot where the people had run away at their approach.</p>
<p>The importance of all these mission stations at the time when the country was not yet pacific can only be realised if one reads the reports of the old travellers. The missions were the outposts of European civilization. They soon became places where the natives did not run away from or fight a European as soon as they saw him.</p>
<p>For the Africans the beneficial activity of all missions, setting aside the religious aspect, cannot be better described than by mentioning the names of the hospitals at Kagondo. Sumve. Kolondoto, Shirati and the first primary schools at Katoke and Ihungu.</p>
<p>Europeans were not the first strange races to enter the country. Many years before they arrived there were Arab traders living in Usukuma and in Bukoba, where the now completely depopulated area of Kafulu in Karagwe was a prosperous trading centre with caravans bringing cloth and beads and taking back ivory. Ivory was the one commodity which was readily accepted by the traders in barter for powder and guns. Any chief in possession of a sufficient number of muzzle loaders could consider himself safe from aggression in tribal wars. Therefore ivory had to be delivered to the chief, just as now it has to be delivered to the Government.</p>
<p>The slave trade did not flourish here as it did on other trade routes. I like to think that the slave traders spared this country because of the good defence put up against it by the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The Arab penetration has left its mark on the country, and in various trading centres, especially in Sukumaland, Arabs, often descendants of the old pioneers, carry on their tradition and help to develop the country. Wherever there is a possibility of growing anything the Arabs have created little oases of fruit trees, and the greatest pride of a white-bearded patriarch is to have a few vines forming a shady pergola.</p>
<p>When the country began to be opened un the Indian traders started to share the trade with the Arabs. They had arrived long before at the coast mainly at Zanzibar and Bagamoyo, where they helped to fit out the expeditions of all the big explorers. Probably the reason for the later arrival of the Indian merchants in the interior is to be found in the form of bussiness which they preferred. They were mainly importers and exporters of goods on a large scale, or they bought wholesale from European importers and they only sent their agents into the interior for retail trading. Their greatest progress was made after the railway was constructed.</p>
<p>Mwanza early became an important trading centre. A photograph taken in 1904 shows a great settlement with clearly a considerable African population and in 1910 there were said to be 90 Europeans in the town.</p>
