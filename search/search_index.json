C. Baker, with whose intimate and extensive knowledge of the history of Dar es Salaam I can make no claim to be able to compete. My excuse is that these writers have dealt mainly with the history of the place during the period before Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar founded the town and during the period after the arrival of the Germans, and, whilst they have made references to the history of Dar es Salaam between those two events, they have not done so in any great detail. Certain events which occurred during that interim period appear to me to have a certain amount of interest and I am therefore venturing to put them on record.</p> <p>Neither Arab chroniclers nor Portuguese writers have anything to tell us regarding the coast of Africa between Kilwa Kisiwani and Bagamoyo, but a string of ancient graveyards between those two places indicates that a number of settlements existed along this coast at various times. One such settlement existed on the raised coral cliff at Ras Chokir near where the Dar es Salaam European Hospital now stands. Another existed on the south side of the bay forming the entrance to Dar es Salaam harbour.<sup>1</sup> At Ras Chokir there were at one time extensive traces of a town as well as of a large cemetery. The edition of the Indian Ocean Directory, which was published in 1882 (pp. 592, 593), tells us that the white tombs on the cliffs were at that date a prominent landmark, showing out well to sea. The 1897 edition of the African Pilot gives us similar information, but soon after the opening of the nineteenth century the tombs began to disappear. A few still remain and from time to time exceptionally heavy spring tides wash out skeletons from the soft crumbling cliff of this headland.</p> <p>History is silent as to the date of the foundation of these settlements, but what is evident from the remains themselves is that, like many other settlements along the coast between Kilwa and Mombasa, they were occupied at one time by persons of mixed Asiatic and African blood, whom the Portuguese called \u201cMoors\u201d in contradistinction to \u2018\u201cCafres,\u201d and whom the Arabs call \u201cpeople of the Swahili (coasts)\u201d in contradistinction to the \u201cinfidels\u201d (Kaffirs) of the interior. The settlers themselves as often as not styled themselves Washirazi, thus alleging, often with some measure of truth, a Persian ancestry.</p> <p>The settlement at Ras Chokir was called Mzizima. It extended south-wards for a distance of about five hundred yards so as to include a village called Mjimwema. A German map of Dar es Salaam, which was published in 1891 and which has been reproduced with Clement Gillman\u2019s article on \u201cDar es Salaam, 1860 to 1940\u201d in No. 20 of Tanganyika Notes and Records, shows this last named place as comprising just over a dozen native huts, including one which has a compound suggesting that it was the residence of the headman. In 1947 there was still living a certain Mwinyiheri bin Akida, who claimed to have been born in the village on Ras Chokir itself.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Dr. Velten informs us that according to the traditions of Swahili elders  which he collected in 1896, the forest was first cleared by people from Barawa on the Somaliland coast and that thereafter \u201cthe Snirazi tilled the land, built boats, fished and traded in slaves.\u201d<sup>3</sup> At some date or other these settlers came to be known as the Washomvi. Like other settlers at Kaole, near Bagamoyo, Konduchi and Mboamaji, they established their settlements in territory belonging te the Wazaramo. Presumably, the settlers made their bargains with the local inhabitants, but it is very evident that those settlements must have depended for their continued existence upon the goodwill of the Wazaramo and, when that goodwill was not forthcoming, upon assistance and support from outside the settlements themselves.</p> <p>At some date, which can only be fixed very conjecturally as being about the beginning of the nineteenth century or the end of the previous century, the Wakamba made their way from their home in Kenya through Usagara down to the coast opposite to Zanzibar. According to one account they overthrew all the Masheha, or local chiefs, between Windi, about nine miles to the north of the mouth of the Kingani River, and the settlement on Ras Chokir. The inhabitants of the coast called to their aid a Mzaramo chief named Rukoli. After some very hard fighting in which the Wazaramo suffered considerable losses, the Wakamba were driven out and returned to their original home, leaving behind only a few isolated settlementsin Usagara.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>According to another account it so happened that, when Mzizima was thus threatened by the invaders, an Arab named Mohammad bin Shale El Hatmi had just beached his dhow which was laden with salt and other merchandise. The Shirazi elders persuaded Mohammad to lend them his cargo so that they might purchase the aid of the Wazaramo. When the Wakamba had been expelled, the Wazaramo were rewarded with land in the neighbourhood of Mzizima. It is also said that thereafter the Shirazi tacitly acknowledged the supremacy of their allies by paying tribute to them.<sup>5</sup> As the inhabitants of that place were unable to repay their debt to him, Mohammad bin Shale liquidated it by marrying a daughter of one of the Shirazi leaders. Thus came into being the Shirazi-Hatmi clan, which took its name, Shomvi or Chomvi from the salt (chumvi), which had been brought in Mohammad bin Shale\u2019s dhow.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Mgungunagwa bin Abubakar Mshomvyi, who ruled as Diwan at Unonio near Kondushi, left innumerable offspring whom he settled at various places along the coast. A grandson of his, named Mwinyikambi, whose grave is still to be seen near the explosives magazines at Magogoni, is said to have been the father of the Washirazi of Mzizima, though he never was installed as Diwan. He was the ancestor of two brothers named Mwinyikambi alias Kitembe and Mohammad alias Jalela, sons of Shomvihaji. both of whom ruled as Diwans of Mzizima. These two Diwans were buried near the present Secretariat at Dar es Salaam. Both tombs still exist. Kitembe\u2019s grave being a big covered structure.</p> <p>Tradition makes Kitembe a contemporary of Seyyid Majid bin Said, who was Sultan of Zanzibar from 1856 to 1870. It is said that in those days there was a Banyan named Mamula living at the place where Seaview now is. Mamula had a son who seduced Kitembe\u2019s daughter. In revenge Mwinyishehe, the girl\u2019s brother, strangled her seducer. The murdered man\u2019s father complained to a half-breed Arab, named Said bin Abdulla El Marahubi. This man was the son of a prominent landowner in Zanzibar by a slave concubine, who belonged to the Pazi clan of the Wazaramo. Said bin Abdalla appears to have exercised at least as great authority in the district as the Diwan himself. He reported the murder to the Sultan of Zanzibar and at the same time informed him that Mzizima was a very fine country. Seyyid Majid decided to go and look at the place on the pretext of investigating the murder. He accordingly set out in a three-masted sailing ship. On arrival he ordered Kitembe to pay compensation to the Banyan\u2019s relatives. At the same time the Washomvi and Wazaramo agreed to allow Seyyid Majid to build stone houses at Mzizima and to give him land for the cultivation of coconuts. Kitembe and his family had to mortgage a shamba close to Magogoni ferry to Said bin Abdulla in order to raise the compensation money payable to the Banyan\u2019s relatives. In addition Seyyid Majid made Said bin Abdulla his akida (officer commanding troops) and put him in charge of his shambas which covered the areas of Gerezani and Kichwele.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>One is disposed to feel that this story has a substratum of truth but that it cannot be correct in all its details. Zanzibar Consular records have nothing to say about the murder at this date of a Banyan at Mzizima and one would rather have expected that the British Consul would have reported the matter to the Bombay Government, if such an offence had in fact occurred.</p> <p>There is, however, evidence that at some date in the earlier half of the nineteenth century Arabs from Muscat and elsewhere were beginning to cross over in fairly large numbers from Zanzibar and to settle at various places along the opposite coast. For instance, we know that a certain Juma bin Mohamed El Nabhani settled at Mboamaji. According to custom he took unto himself a wife from amongst the daughters of Heth, marrying an African woman who bore him one son and two daughters. The son was named Muhammad and the eldest daughter was commonly known as Mwana Arabu. When their father had made his fortune, he returned to Muscat taking his son with him, but leaving his eldest daughter behind at Mboamaji. Eventually, Juma\u2019s son, Muhammad, returned from Muscat to Mboamaji in company with a Muscat Arab named Rajab bin Said bin Muhammad El Marjebi. On arrival at Mboamaji Juma gave his sister Mwana Arabu in marriage to his companion Rajab. Mwana Arabu gave birth to a son, named Muhammad, who begot a son, whose proper name was Ahmed bin Muhammad El Marjebi, but who was better known to fame as Tippu Tib. It was from Mboamaji that this famous slave and ivory trader set out on his second journey to Tabora in the early 1860\u2019s.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Family histories such as that of Tippu Tib and his forebears must have been by no means uncommon. On the other hand, the European trader was deliberately excluded by the Sultans of Zanzibar from the most lucrative portions of the trade on the mainland. In the commercial treaty which Seyyid Said bin Sultan concluded with Great Britain in 1839 he specially reserved for himself a monopoly and the exclusive privilege of sale of ivory and gum copal between the ports of Mtangata and Kilwa Kisiwani. A similar reservation was made in the treaty which he concluded with France in 1846 and which his son, Seyyid Majid, concluded with the Hanseatic Republics of Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg in 1899.<sup>9</sup> Whilst no such reservation was contained in the earlier treaty which Seyyid Said concluded with the United States of America in 1833, he vigorously protested in 1847 against an attempt by the American Consul to assert the right of Americans to trade on the mainland and, following upon his protest, no further attempt was made to maintain that right.<sup>10</sup> As will be seen, this bar on trade in ivory and copal did not operate against Banyan and Muslim traders from India. many of whom came from the independent states of Cutch and Kathiawar.</p> <p>Turning to European records, it is somewhat remarkable that neither Owen in the course of his hydrographical survey of the East African coast between the years 1822 and 1825 nor Guillain some twenty years later realised the existence of a large land-locked harbour to the south of Mzizima. Owing to stress of weather, the dhow in which the missionary Krapf was sailing in 1850 to Kilwa put into the harbour of Msasani to the north of Ras Chokir and stayed there some thirty-six hours, but the dhow by-passed the harbour just to the south when it continued its voyage.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>In 1859 Burton and Speke reached the coast on their return from the discovery of Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria. Burton thus describes the event:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>The 3rd February 1859 saw us winding through the poles decorated with skulls\u2014they now grin in the Royal College of Surgeons, London\u2014 a negro Temple Bar which pointed out the way into the little maritime village of Konduchi.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>... A general procession conducted the strangers to the hut, swept, cleaned, and garnished for us by old Premji, the principal Banyan of the headquarter village ...</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We were detained at Konduchi for six days between the 3rd and 10th February \u2026<sup>50</sup></p> <p>Quote</p> <p>One day we were surprised by the abrupt entrance of a youth, eminently North German in aspect. He announced himself as Dr. Albrecht Roscher, of Hamburg....  He stayed with us two days and then departed northwards.<sup>51</sup></p> <p>Burton had a good deal more to say about Roscher than I have set out but, as much of it is uncomplimentary and also unjust, there is no need to repeat those remarks here. Burton is, moreover, wrong in saying Roscher went northward. In actual fact he landed at Konduchi on February 9 from the dhow, which had come from Zanzibar and which next day conveyed Burton and Speke to Kilwa. As happened with Krapf, their dhow by-passed the harbour at Mzizima. Burton tells us that \u201cour course lay past the settlements of Msasani and Magogoni and the little Mbwezi river to Mboamaji, \u201crain water\u201d in the Mission Map called Mburomaji, vulgarly Boromaji. The little port-village with jungle rolling up to the walls, and anchorage defended by the Simba Islets, is a favourite entrance to the East African interior.\u201d<sup>12</sup></p> <p>Roscher likewise headed southwards, and not northwards, as Burton would have us understand. He, however, travelled overland and on foot. On February 10, the day of Burton\u2019s departure from Konduchi, he reached Msasani. Two days later he reached Mzizima. On February 13 he crossed the harbour mouth and proceeded to Mageogoni.<sup>13</sup> There is no need to follow his later journeyings. Later in the year he reached the shore of Lake Nyasa a few weeks after Livingstone had reached its southern end. A few months afterwards he was murdered. As an explorer he may not have made any great discoveries, but to him at least belongs the credit of being the first European to set eyes on what is now called the harbour of Dar es Salaam.</p> <p>On September 26, 1860, Colonel Rigby, British Consul at Zanzibar. arrived at Bagamoyo with Speke and Grant on the first stage of the two latters\u2019 journey through Uganda to Cairo.<sup>14</sup> One of the objects of Rigby\u2019s visit to Bagamoyo was to liberate slaves, who had been acquired by Indians. For this purpose he stayed in Bagamoyo until September 30 when Speke and Grant struck camp and set out on their first march into the interior of the continent. During his stay Rigby liberated the slaves of five Indian owners\u2014residing in Bagamoyo, five other Indian owners residing at Konduchi, two other owners residing at Mzizima, and two others at Magogoni.<sup>15</sup> The figures are not without interest as indicating the relative prosperity of the four places just named. By this date Bagamoyo was the recognised outlet for a caravan route leading from Lake Tanganyika to the coast. Another route, which branched from this route near the coast, proceeded according to Erhardt\u2019s famous \u201dSlug Map\u201d (compiled in 1855) to Mboamaji. As already seen, Burton and Speke diverged from the same route to Konduchi, which appears to have provided as much business for Indians at this date as did Bagamoyo. On the other hand trade at Magogoni and Mzizima (also marked on Erhardt\u2019s map) was on a much smaller scale.</p> <p>To those who know Dar es Salaam today it may at first seem a matter for surprise that the advantages of this landlocked harbour were not appreciated earlier than they actually were. In order to find the reason we must go back to the days before steam. The harbour entrance is narrow and tortuous and therefore difficult for a vessel which is not capable of quick manoeuvring. During spring tides the stream is strong in the harbour channel, especially towards or after low water, as it is then con- fined to the channel itself. The ebb tide sets eastwards over towards the islands, which serve as a breakwater to the harbour entrance, and there is a risk of a vessel being swept in on them. Steam or other mechanical power will enable a vessel to counteract these tendencies of tide and current, but a sailing vessel of moderate size could not answer its helm or manoeuvre so quickly, more especially when either monsoon was blowing in any strength. For dhows and the like the entrance to Dar es Salaam was tricky and risky. More or less open roadsteads such as Bagamoyo therefore had a greater attraction for them. Even such harbours as Mboamaji, Msasani Bay and Konduchi, which had the protection of outlying reefs, appear to have thrived as sea ports to a far larger extent than the one lying just to the south of Mzizima.</p> <p>Another reason why the harbour did not attract Arab or other settlers earlier than it did was the hostility of the Wazaramo. In 1845 a French explorer named Maizan had been murdered a short distance inland from Bagamoyo at the instigation of Mazungera, whom Burton describes as the \u201cPhazi\u201d, a \u201cchief of the Wakamba, a sub-tribe of the Wazaramu\u201d.<sup>16</sup> Owing to pressure from the French Government Seyyid Said was compelled to send a punitive expedition against Mazungera. The expedition followed the same course as a number of other expeditions against the same person. There was very little fighting. Such fighting as there was gave Mazungera time to make himself scarce and the expedition returned to Zanzibar, having made a prisoner of the man who beat the drum at the time of Maizan\u2019s murder. His captors passed him off to the French Consul at Zanzibar as Mazungera himself.<sup>17</sup></p> <p>Mazungera was to prove a source of trouble for several years to come. In 1861 he began to infest the caravan routes leading from the interior and to intimidate Banyan traders on the coast near Mzizima. Seyyid Suleiman bin Ahmed El Busaidi, the Governor of Zanzibar, led a force against him. Suleiman subsequently informed the British Consul, Colonel Pelly, \u201cthat he followed the Phazi to his main haunt, but the Phazi escaped through a postern into the bush,\u201d whereafter, deeming that honour was. satisfied, Seyyid Suleiman returned to Zanzibar. Later in the same year the Banyans again complained that their lives and property were in danger and asked for the despatch of a punitive expedition. The Sultan sent a small force across to Magogoni, but this met with no greater success than the previous one and for precisely the same reason. Mazungera once again managed to make his getaway.<sup>18</sup></p> <p>According to accounts given to Dr. Velten in 1896 by Swahili elders, Suleiman bin Ahmed must have returned to Mzizima very shortly after this last expedition. He brought presents with him, having been commis- sioned by Seyyid Majid to acquire land from the local inhabitants for the building of a new capital.<sup>19</sup> Seyyid Suleiman was an interesting personality. He had been born in about 1787 and was a distant cousin of Seyyid Said, father of Seyyid Majid. When Seyyid Said first visited Zanzibar in 1828, he left his cousin in charge there as Wazir, guardian and adviser to his favourite son, Khalid. In 1844 the British Consul Hamerton described Suleiman bin Ahmed as \u201cnot a clever man, but a kind, good sort of a person\u201d who had much influence with the pagan chiefs on the coast of Africa.<sup>20</sup> This statement sufficiently indicated that he was: pre-eminently suitable for the delicate task of inducing the local inhabitants to make grants of land to Seyyid Majid. The negotiations: went through quite amicably. The original acquisition included the areas of Gerezani and Kichwele.<sup>21</sup> Either at the same date or else a little later Seyyid Majid also acquired considerable areas of land at Kurasini and Upanga, which with those at Gerezani and Kichwele,<sup>22</sup> were largely given over to cultivation of coconuts and rice. As a German map of 1891 shows, the land occupied by the Washomvi at Ras Chokir and Mjimwema remained in the undisturbed possession of its original owners, though, as already seen, other land nearer to the Magogoni ferry was apparently mortgaged to the Arab Said bin Abdullah El Marahubi, in order to satisfy a claim for blood money.</p> <p>I can find no record of any building operations at Dar es Salaam until the latter days of 1865. On January 16, 1866, the British Consul at Fane Gae informed the Senior Naval Officer on the East Coast of Africa that he had issued a pass to sixteen of the Sultan of Zanzibar\u2019s slaves to proceed to Dar es Salaam \u201cto be employed on the works in progress there.\u201d<sup>23</sup> As we learn from the sixth edition of the Indian Ocean Directory (pp. 589, 590), the stone for most of the buildings was taken from the islands which form the eastern breakwater protecting the entrance to Dar es Salaam harbour.</p> <p>Later in 1866 Seyyid Majid paid a personal visit to his new capital. He was accompanied there by Dr. Seward, the acting British Consul, who on November 10, 1866, made the following report to the Bombay Government:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cI have the honour to report the return of the Sultan after a ten days\u2019 absence at Dar es Salaam, the proposed site of a new town on the mainland littoral a few hours\u2019 steaming south of Zanzibar.</p> <p>The Sultan is expending large sums of money upon the transport of building materials to this place, where he is at present erecting a palace, a port, and dwellings for his officials. His Highness hopes to form the nucleus at least of a trading port, whence caravan routes shall radiate into the interior and which bye-and-bye may connect with the northern and southern ports of Keelwa and Lamoo.</p> <p>The conception is good but the one want of labour appears to be fatal to its realisation. No considerable body of slaves could be kept together there. Forty are said to have decamped during the short stay of His Highness. The settlements of Lamoo and Mombassa are flanked by tribes more dangerous to the fugitive slave than the Arab, but the \u2018country behind Dhar Salaam has no such flight-restraining terror.</p> <p>The capacity of the new port for shipping is of the best. A narrow but deep channel leads to a chain of harbours that extends several miles inland. These harbours receive the outflow of a river which never dries up. The narrowness of the leading channel is a drawback which only the presence of a steam tug can countervail. This want has been anticipated and a powerful steam tug ordered from Hamburgh.</p> <p>The question of health is a serious one as affecting the future of Dar es Salaam. The Banians declare it to be a fever stricken place. scarce habitable during the rainy season, but then they are opposed to the withdrawal of trade from the time honoured depots on the coast. Concentration implies competition and lessens profits. Arabs are reluctant to patronise the new venture. Their slaves would flee. They too declare it unhealthy, but not loudly, for examples have been made of some who gave Dhar Salaam a bad character. The slanderers were flogged. The hale and robust air of every dweller whom during a recent visit I encountered gave no support, however, to its ill repute.</p> <p>Its water supply appeared to be sufficient and good irrespective of the stream before mentioned. Shallow lakes, frequented by water fowl, were found in the immediate neighbourhood of the new site: and the Arab Governor drew my attention to numerous little hills (sic. ? wells) of beautifully sweet water percolating through the high banks of white aluminous marl.... (? adjoining) the first harbour.</p> <p>As the soil is a sandy humus, the humus must be.... capable of growing either sugar or cotton, but its grain growing value is un- doubted. To attract cultivation, His Highness offers .... (? free land) in any reasonable measure to those who will undertake agriculture in its neighbourhood. The sole condition attached to the gift is that the land be made to yield produce and kept under cultivation.</p> <p>I have stated that no considerable body of slaves could be kept together at Dhar Salaam unless their slave labour can be largely supplemented or entirely replaced by free labour. There is no hope of any extension of this projected mainland settlement and of the seeming prosperity which on the considerable island of Zanzibar is sustained by violent and purely artificial means.\u201d<sup>52</sup></p> <p>Building operations appear to have proceeded very slowly. The Sultan\u2019s palace was still unfinished when Pere Horner of the Holy Ghost Mission visited the place in November, 1867.<sup>24</sup> Very little further progress had been made when Tippu Tib reached Dar es Salaam with a caravan from the interior on January 19, 1868. Tippu Tib had reached the place in the last week of Ramadhan. He found Seyyid Majid observing the fast in his unfinished palace. Tippu Tib\u2019s biographer gives the following account of Tippu Tib\u2019s stay:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>For the time being things were lively in Dar es Salaam. All who belonged to \u2018society\u2019 had proceeded with the Sultan\u2019s Court to the new capital. All the non-trading Consuls and a great number of other Europeans, all the better-class Arabs from Zanzibar, Pemba, Mombasa and Lamu, as well as a great body of Indians, had followed the Sovereign. Among the latter were all the creditors of Tippoo Tib, in whom the arrival of the caravan naturally evoked great delight: for on seeing the rich spoil in ivory they felt certain of receiving back the money they had advanced with high interest. But beside this the coming of the caravan excited the greatest interest in all circles as being the first one bound for the coast to reach the new capital. The Sultan himself showed interest in the daring voyager, whom he loaded with high honours and entertained as his guest until the \u2018Great Feast\u2019, which concludes the month of fasting (Known in Turkey as the \u2018Festival of Bairam\u2019).</p> <p>A   fter the feast the whole Court returned to Zanzibar in three ships, headed by the Sultan and his notables and the foreign representativeson board a French man-of-war, while the remaining Arabs and the Indians followed in two smaller vessels.<sup>25</sup></p> <p>In July, 1863, H.M.S. \u201cDaphne\u201d called at Dar es Salaam. Her commanding officer, Captain G. L. Sulivan, gave the following account of the visit:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Dr. Kirk being anxious for an interview with the Sultan, who was at this time residing at his palace on the mainland at Darra Salaam, asked me to convey him across in the \u201cDaphne\u201d previous to our final departure for the south; thither therefore we proceeded, having on board Dr. and Mrs. Kirk and their baby, for whom a patent cradle was constructed out of the lid of a box and two chairs.</p> <p></p> <p>Hamed bin Muhammed (Tippu Tib)</p> <p>(This is believed to be the only photograph now in existence)</p> <p>Bishop Tozer also formed one of the party; he had had a severe attack of fever, and I had persuaded him to accompany us for change of air, that of Darra Salaam being cool and refreshing, as compared with the low, marshy, fever and dysentery producing isle of Zanzibar, and he returned with us at the end of a week quite another man.</p> <p>It had just become the Sultan\u2019s new abode, he having built himself a palace here; another building had also been erected, a kind of official hotel for foreign consuls, or others, on their visits from Zanzibar, and there Dr. and Mrs. Kirk took up their abode, the Bishop remaining on board. At the end of the week we returned to Zanzibar.\u201d<sup>53</sup></p> <p>Captain Sulivan took a photograph of Dar es Salaam, which has been reproduced as an engraving in his book \u201cDhow Chasing.\u201d The half-fortress, half-palace of Seyyid Majid is therein depicted with a flag flying on its roof. Behind it is a mosque. It is not easy to make out which of the other buildings is the hotel. The photograph shows that quite a number of substantial and well built houses had been more or less completed by this date.</p> <p>In 1870 a Select Parliamentary Committee on the East African Slave Trade recommended that certain measures should be taken for the reduction of the traffic in slaves with an ultimate view to the final abolition thereof. They recommended that the shipment of slaves from the mainland should be confined to one port and that that port should be Dar es Salaam, where a Consular Officer should be posted. The British Government adopted these recommendations and drafted a treaty for presentation to the Sultan of Zanzibar. H. A. Churchill, the British Consul at Zanzibar, embodied the terms, including the provision confining the exvort of slaves to Dar es Salaam, in an Arabic letter addressed to Seyyid Majid. Churchill later reported that the Sultan \u201ctook some time to consider the matter, and at last, being pressed, he said he would discuss the question with me and wanted me to go over with him to the coast for that purpose. I was prepared to go, but he was so ill at the time that he begged me to put it off until he could send me notice; instead of that he came back himself and ten days after that he died.\u201d Seyyid Majid died on October 8, 1870, and his brother Seyyid Barghash succeeded to the throne. Whilst Majid was still living, Barghash had assured Churchill that, in the event of his succeeding his brother, he would comply with the wishes of the British Government. But on October 10, when reminded of his promise, \u201che repudiated everything and said that he had made no arrangement whatsoever; that he had never promised anything; that it was false, and even had he done so, he was not Sultan. then.\u201d<sup>26</sup></p> <p>There were other signs that there had arisen a new ruler in the land who was anxious to break with much of the immediate past. In the early days of Majid\u2019s reign Barghash had attempted to supplant his brother by force of arms. For this he had been temporarily. banished to India, but had been allowed after some time to return to Zanzibar. Though outwardly there had then been a reconciliation between the two brothers, it was notorious that neither had ever forgiven the other. It was consequently almost instinctive in Barghash to decline to further any of his brother\u2019s projects. Amongst other things he washed his hands entirely of all schemes for the development of Dar es Salaam. So long as Seyyid Majid held court there, it had been a centre of attraction for business, which would otherwise have gone elsewhere. When Seyyid Barghash withdrew his patronage, all the recently created prosperity of Dar es Salaam vanished. As already seen, there had been a number of Banyans and Arabs, who had cried down the place in Seyyid Majid\u2019s time. Now that there was no Sultan to chastise them with whips for so doing, their voices were raised again and a ready ear given to them by Seyyid Barghash.</p> <p>On April 15, 1872, Dar es Salaam met with a further setback in the shape of a hurricane, which set in from the S.S.W. and reached as far as Bagamoyo on the mainland. It did great damage to shipping, buildings and plantations in Zanzibar, but does not appear to have wrought the same havoc on the mainland. Two buoys, which were moored outside the entrance to Dar es Salaam harbour, were washed ashore. It is somewhat typical of the utter lack of interest of Seyyid Barghash in the place that ten years later neither of these buoys had been restored to its proper position.<sup>27</sup></p> <p>In about July, 1873, a dispute arose about a woman between a slave of Seyyid Barghash and a member of the local tribe. In the course of the dispute one of the local inhabitants was killed. Thereupon his fellow tribesmen demanded the life of the slave as of right. The Akida referred the matter to the Sultan and was ordered on no account to give up the slave and to attack the natives, if necessary. No actual fighting took place, but on hearing the orders of the Sultan, the local inhabitants stopped sending in produce from the interior. Shortly afterwards feeling was further intensified when another native was assaulted and severely wounded by one of the Sultan\u2019s soldiers, despite his protest that he had nothing to do with the people in the original dispute. The Akida paid a large sum in compensation to the wounded man, but the trade boycott was even more rigidly enforced and all local barter ended. The result was that in about September, 1873, a number of Banyans and Khojas removed to Magogoni, Tuliani, and other neighbouring villages, where a brisk copal trade rapidly sprang up, to the prejudice of Dar es Salaam.</p> <p>In December, 1873, Vice-Consul Elton visited Dar es Salaam, Magogoni and Tuliani. His primary duty was to emancipate slaves held by Indians under British jurisdiction and protection. When called upon to declare the number of slaves held by them the members of the Indian community declared only twenty-four, but subsequent enquiries produced sixty-four more. All these were emancipated and in one bad case the owner was prosecuted and fined. Prosecution in another equally bad case was impossible because the owner implicated set off for Zanzibar on the day of the Vice-Consul\u2019s arrival at Dar es Salaam and returned on the day of his departure.<sup>28</sup></p> <p>On January 7, 1874, Elton wrote a report on Dar es Salaam, which is so full of interest that it deserves to be set out in full:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>The Sultan\u2019s residence is built at the inland extremity of the basin, and is to the far right of the town, and from it a line of stone houses should form a crescent facing the anchorage, with a broad road and flights of steps communicating with the sandy beach, on the inner line of which wells, affording a good supply of fresh water, are conveniently constructed. But time, neglect, and weather are rapidly destroying the steps, terraces, and wells; only two of the houses are habitable, and the others are stopped short at the first storey, a low thatched barn does duty for the Custom-house in the broad overgrown field which marks the site allotted by Seyed Majid for the erection of a more pretentious structure; the boldly designed main streets are choked up with rank grasses and bush-wood, the houses of the most part deserted and locked up, or giving way to decay, except at one enterprising corner where a few Indians industriously strive to revive a failing trade with the interior. House property is almost valueless, and land around so depreciated that a plantation of some extent was shown me for sale, at a price of 40 dollars. A plot of land and a half-finished house in the centre of the town, mortgaged about two years ago for 500 dollars, would not fetch a reserve of 200 dollars when offered lately by auction; at the same time a thatched hut and two acres, in a good situation, went for 7 dollars. Yet the climate is healthy, the air clear, and fevers uncommon and easily shaken off,\u2014so say the inhabitants,\u2014the site a beautiful one, and the surrounding country green and well wooded; nevertheless there hangs about the scene a gloomy appearance, and the idea suggested itself that the desolation must be connected with the smash of some limited liability company, which has been compelled to stop work, and failed to attract the public by its preliminary outlays to see the advantages of a new seaside settlement.</p> <p>The Akhidah, Rashk Allah, an Arab of Sheher, represents the Sultan\u2019s authority, and is supported by a few mercenaries, Arabs, Baluchis, and half-castes. A guard is kept at his house, where there are a quantity of muskets, matchlocks, and old powder-horns stored for the purpose of equipping the 200 slaves, who work on Barghash\u2019s extensive plantations, in case of disturbances with neighbouring tribes. Two or three Arabs pine on the outlying estates, and a host of the Mrima half-castes idle and shuffle about the town and adjacent villages, living from hand to mouth on the produce of their slaves, and on small trading ventures which they send in their charge towards the Uzaramo country.</p> <p>The Indian community of Dar es Salaam is represented by:\u2014 1 Wannia; 13 Battiahs; 1 Mooltani; 3 Bhoras and 3 Khojas, with families; whilst in the neighbouring villages, where the copal trade has gone, Magogoni contains 13 Battiahs, 1 Bhora and 3 Khojas; and Tuliani, 10 Battiahs and 10 Khojas, the latter with families.</p> <p>A primary mistake was made by an attempt to force the Dar es Salaam trade, to the prejudice of other ports further north, which had before enjoyed the monopoly of caravans from the interior, for, after a glimmer of success, the death of Seyed Majid, and the withdrawal of patronage from the town, was at once followed by the natives resuming the popular and old times. It is now a long period since any caravan of value has been down, although the people live on rumours of a rich arrival en route; a small quantity of ivory, it is true, did reach from Unyamwezi during my stay, but it represented the venture of one man, and had no influence upon local trade. Ivory pays to the Dewan a \u201cMoorba\u201d of 3 dollars per frasilah, when brought in by those tribes of the Washenzi, who trade habitually, or by Arabs, or by Waswahili, and a further 12 dollars per frasilah on arrival at Zanzibar. If brought in by Washenzi, who are not habitually traders to the port, it pays 6 dollars per frasilah to the Dewan, but 9 dollars at Zanziar. Thus, in each instance, the total amount of duty per frasilah, 15 dollars, is the same. A few tusks find their way down from high (? the high- lands) into the Uzaramo country, where elephants are still said to be found in considerable numbers. The india-rubber liana is in abundant quantities in the close vicinity, and, at one time was exported largely at from 9 dollars to 10 dollars a frasilah. Its collection was stopped in consequence of leopards attacking boys gathering the juice, several being killed, and a fall in price; and it is now being destroyed wholesale, together with the copal trees, in the extensive clearings carried on by the Sultan, in order to add to his land under cultivation. These plantations are thickly planted with coconut trees, as yet young, and muhogo; some fine mango trees are to be seen, but the oil tree palms introduced are progressing but slowly. Wax is seldom brought in now by the Washenzi; the copal is almost entirely diverted to Magogoni and Tuliani. At these latter villages, towards evening, armed parties appear with the gum and spend the night in bargaining with the Indians, 2 dollars are often asked for what is worth 6d., and long and difficult negotiations invariably precede the handshake which cements the deal, but this once given no dispute is known to follow . Millet, Indian corn, and rice, of several varieties, senna, and bungala are grown throughout the district, which exports to Zanzibar, but (? not) to a great extent.</p> <p>The copal trade, intermixed with grain speculations, and the lending moneys and goods at a rate of 8 per cent per mensem to small traders who sneak about the upper lands and are seldom absent for more than three months at a time on a single venture, these are the commerce of the Indian. Lower down in the Chungu-bueni district, and the fine Kwale district, he would find more copal, more ivory, more general trade, but would there have to pay blackmail on all his profits to half-a-dozen self-styled Sultans. Here he is effectually protected from oppression, the Sultan\u2019s authority being maintained, and, although he sighs for the greater gains, yet he deems it prudent to be in a secure atmosphere, and away from the slave caravan line end its lawless followings, and in the main he is, I think, right.</p> <p>The slave caravans strike the coast above Dar es Salaam, turning off from the Kisiju road, near Mboamaji, and making for the Dar es Salaam river, which they cross about five miles from the sea, near Seyed bin Abdullah\u2019s (a worthless, cringing Arab, and a wine-bibber), from thence their path passes through the Sultan\u2019s plantations and skirts close past the town. The straighter road, via Tuliani and Magogoni, is now seldom adopted as the ferry over the entrance to the river, which must be crossed, presents a danger. Their numbers and their destination might here become known, and they fear in- formation finding its way across to Zanzibar. Recently, the caravans have so increased in size and numbers, that the Akidah, who, as a rule, avoided the subject, one day expressed his astonishment, and went so far (he, an Arab of Sheher with natural Slave Trade propensities) as to say \u2018he had never seen anything so shameful, it was only killing man, not trading.\u2019</p> <p>Religion does not cause dissension in the Dar es Salaam district. The Shafis and the Bohras coalesce in many points, the Khojas follow their own line quietly, whilst the prejudices of the Battiah are never wantonly outraged; neither do politics ruffle the pool with more than a passing ripple. One day resembles another with its money making and eternal gossiping, and pleasant idling; ample regrets follow relations of the past prosperity when Seyed Majid was King, and caravans headed by flags and men firing guns swaggered through the street to receive royal presents, and men of high estate from Zanzibar spent their revenues open-handed; but nothing is done, Barghash is pronounced \u2018the unlucky\u2019, and tomorrow is a counterpart of yesterday.</p> <p>Yet that the country presents admirable facilities for sugar growing, even for European settlements ,is evident to all. It appears the one healthy spot on the Mrima; cattle thrive, it is pleasant to the eye to rest upon; alluvial, well-wooded plains roll back to the Uzaramo hills and the neighbours, undisturbed, are harmless.</p> <p>The slave population appears fairly well off in the district: food is cheap, and fish plentifully caught all along the coast and in the river. Miles of staked enclosures fronting the sea form preserves, which are fished and re-fished assiduously, and boats work the outlying banks for \u2018bonito\u2019. During the three \u2018days to themselves\u2019, commonly given to slaves, they collect large quantities of salt with which they do a small trade, and manage to secure something for daily necessaries.\u201d<sup>54</sup></p> <p>In 1877 the process of gradual! deterioration was to some extent checked when work was begun on what was afterwards known as the Mackinnon Road. The scheme was promoted and paid for by Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Mackinnon and the second Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton. Their object was to open effective communication for wheeled traffic with Lake Nyasa and by that means to develop legitimate forms of commerce between the coast and the interior and thus gradually to eradicate the slave trade. The completion of the road was regarded as a matter of vital urgency and the first working party was instructed to commence operations and not to lose time in making preliminary explorations. On Kirk\u2019s advice work was begun at Dar es Salaam.<sup>29</sup></p> <p>By July, 1877. six miles had been completed, but one serious obstacle had already come to light. Edmund Buxton, brother of Sir Thomas, reported that he had discovered tsetse fly in the low hills near the coast. This virtually destroyed all hope of using bullock or donkey transport on the road. Nevertheless, the work went ahead and by Sentember, 1877, fifteen miles had been completed. Then Mazungera, the descendant and namesake of Maizan\u2019s murderer, tried to bar the way by demanding pay- ment for permission to proceed. When news of this reached Zanzibar, the Sultan instructed his Akida at Dar es Salaam to proceed with an armed force to the spot and put an end to this obstruction. The arrival of the troops had the desired effect. The opposition melted away and the work proceeded as before.<sup>30</sup></p> <p>In 1879 four elephants made their way up this road into the interior. These animals were not denizens of Africa. They had been acquired through William Mackinnon\u2019s instrumentality in Bombay by the International African Association, which had been established under the auspices of Leopold II of the Belgians to promote the exploration and civilisation of Africa. The elephants had been conveyed together with ~ their mahouts across the Indian Ocean in the \u201cChinsura,\u201d a steam vessel of two thousand tons. It was deemed unsafe to take the vessel into Dar es Salaam harbour. The \u2018\u201cChinsura\u201d therefore anchored in Msasani Bay on May 31, 1879. One animal was lowered into the sea by the ship\u2019s derricks and after some demur was persuaded by its mahout to swim to the land. Next day the \u201cChinsura\u201d was taken closer inshore and the remaining three animals were landed. They were taken thence to Dar es Salaam, whence they set out on July 2, 1879, along the Mackinnon Road on the first stage of their journey to Lake Tanganyika. Only one of the four reached its destination, the other three dying on the way. The sole survivor reached Karema on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in December, but soon suffered the same fate as its companions.<sup>31</sup></p> <p>In the meantime the Mackinnon Road was gradually penetrating further into the interior. By the end of 1879 it had reached its fortieth mile.<sup>32</sup> in 1881 Kirk visited the road which had by this time extended seventy-three miles inland. Previous visitors had formed a poor opinion as to the manner of its construction and its potential value as a means of communication.<sup>33</sup> But Kirk was a bit more comnvlimentary. He thought that on the whole it was well constructed and would require little labour to keep it open. But animal transport was out of the question and the road had not so far taoped any highway of commerce. In Kirk\u2019s opinion it was never likely to become a trade route to Lake Nyasa, though William Mackinnon and Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton were to be con- gratulated \u201con the benefit conferred by them on the country.\u201d<sup>34</sup></p> <p>We hear no more of any progress on the Mackinnon Road after Kirk\u2019s visit. It was a private venture. Lake Nyasa lay more than four hundred miles beyond roadhead and at the then rate of progress it would take another twenty-five years to complete the task. Kirk\u2019s report had come the nearest to bestowing any benediction on the enterprise and even that had hardly been more than damning with faint praise. In the circumstances one is not surprised to learn that the undertakers gave up the stupendous task. Six years later, according to Dr. Franz Stuhlmann, the road had \u201cbecome deteriorated and overgrown as it was no longer used as a road.\u201d<sup>35</sup> Nevertheless it was still discernible in 1894 when Lieutenant von Schlobach of the German army made a survey of the proposed railway between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro. In his report this officer says: \u201cPast Yombo to beyond Kongoromboto my railway trace follows the Mackinnon Road which it then leaves to gain Kiserawe Mission by a north-westerly development .... About one kilometre beyond Kiserawe the railway trace again reaches the Mackinnon Road and follows it down into Mpiyi valley.\u201d<sup>36</sup> There consequently would appear to be little doubt that, except for a few deviations, the present motor road between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro follows the same alignment as did the Mackinnon Road for its first seventy miles.</p> <p>Mackinnon and Buxton did not labour entirely in vain. As the former once said of a subsequent East African undertaking of his, he and his colleague could claim to have taken out their dividends in philanthropy. In other words, Kirk was right when he said that they had conferred a benefit on the country through which their road passed.</p> <p>The local inhabitants very soon began to appreciate the advantages of the road. In July, 1877, as many as a hundred natives a day were stated to be using the road bringing rice, india rubber and copal into Dar es Salaam.<sup>37</sup> When Lieutenant Henry O\u2018Neill visited Dar es Salaam in the early days of 1879 he reported that the Wazaramo were doing a lucrative trade in rubber, which they sold \u201cto the buyers on the road\u201d and that about 1,000-1,500 frasilas (35,000-52,500 lbs.) had been exported from Dar es Salaam during the preceding twelve months. There were also extensive traces of copal digging. In fact, \u201cthe country has become almost honeycombed by it, and it is almost dangerous for the passage of any beasts of burden.\u201d In addition, \u201ca few trees here and there in the country surrounding Dar es Salaam represent what at one time must have been a dense copal forest,\u201d but O\u2019Neill was unable to form an estimate as to the quantity shipped from the port.<sup>38</sup></p> <p>This report was fully confirmed by Dr. Kirk two years later. He found copal trees existing throughout Uzaramo, but most of the copal was obtained by digging for the semi-fossil resin. According to him rubber was obtainable in such abundance that not even the reckless mode of tapping employed by the natives had seriously affected the supply.<sup>39</sup></p> <p>Nearer to Dar es Salaam a number of coconut plantations had come into being. Some were owned by the Sultan and others by private land- owners. Native tradition has it that one of the very first acts which Seyyid Majid did after acquiring land near Mzizima was tc send for some Arabs and say to them, \u201cplant the seeds which I shall send you from Unguja (Zanzibar) and till my land in this country.\u201d<sup>40</sup> Doubtless the planting of these seedlings was partly intended as an outward and visible symbol of the Sultan\u2019s entry into possession, but it was also a case of sound husbandry. In 1879 O\u2019Neill reported that the Sultan\u2019s plantations contained about 36,000 trees of which about three-fifths were bearing. In addition, some 2,000-3,000 seedlings had been planted during the last two years.<sup>41</sup></p> <p>Though the explorer Keith Johnston, writing in 1881, had little to say in praise of Mackinnon Road, he had to admit that it carried a considerable amount of traffic. Writing in the same year Kirk said:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>The Wazaramo, who have been brought under the influence of the road, are one of the most degraded and troublesome tribes on the coast, and until the country had been opened up it was unsafe for any but an armed party to attempt to pass. Being cowards, they took advantage of the dense jungles and thickets through which the narrow paths had to pass, and kidnapped and plundered stragglers, thus extorting payment. Their utter weakness has now become manifest wherever the road has reached, and any one may traverse the country es it and without danger of molestation if only he follows the road.</p> <p>On the people themselves also an influence has been obtained, for I notice that along many miles of road they had formed extensive fields in the adjacent lands, and had commenced to settle in open and cleared spaces, leaving their stockaded villages in the jungle.<sup>55</sup></p> <p>Kirk also hoped that the road might prove an effective check in the overland traffic in slaves. For some time past, in order to escape the vigilance of British men-of-war, slaves from Kilwa and other places to the south had been marched overland to such ports as Pangani and Tanga and conveyed thence surreptitiously in canoes or small vessels to Zanzibar and Pemba. The Mackinnon Road cut right across this coastal route and there is no doubt that, if the Sultan of Zanzibar\u2019s troops had effectively patrolled the road, many of the slave caravans could have been intercepted and the slaves rescued. But Kirk was constantly complaining of the non possumus attitude adopted by the Akidas commanding the Sultan\u2019s troops in Dar es Salaam. However, in justice to those officers it must be allowed that the personnel upon which they had to rely was most unsatisfactory.</p> <p>In 1873 the Wazaramo had been plundering travellers near Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam and the Sultan\u2019s irregular troops had been called out to deal with the situation. The campaign appears to have followed the same form as previous ones. As soon as the soldiers appeared, the enemy disappeared and no attempt was made to round up the offenders. Soon thereafter Lieutenant O\u2019Neill reports that:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Relations between the Sultan\u2019s authorities at Dar es Salaam and the Wazaramo, with whom they came in contact during the late war, flavour somewhat of an armed neutrality and the soldiers are even now afraid of proceeding through the country thirty miles in the interior, unless in such force as to withstand any reprisals that may be made. Two, who were ordered to accompany me by the Akida absolutely refused to proceed with me beyond the \u2018bungalow\u2019 (sc. on the Mackinnon Road), where a force of ten is stationed, alleging the hostile feeling on the part of the natives to be the cause and I believe that, until this feeling has subsided, it would be safer for European travellers to walk alone than to be accompanied by such an escort.<sup>56</sup>.</p> <p>In 1880 a native interpreter on board H.M.S. \u201cRuby\u201d reported that slave caravans from the south were stooping short of Dar es Salaam at Mboamaji, whence slaves were transported either to the island of Uzi off the south coast of Zanzibar or else were being sent round the east coast of Zanzibar to Pemba.<sup>42</sup> When Kirk himself visited Dar es Salaam a year later he learnt \u201cthat in Dar es Salaam itself there is an amount of transfer of slaves from hand to hand which could not be the consequence of local wants alone,\u201d and the situation required \u201cmore careful watching than I am able to give.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>The Sultan\u2019s headman, a chief of the handful of irregulars, for there is no Governor, is not a person who impressed me on this occasion favourably, and I have mentioned this to His Highness. The slave trade here is, however, very small, and the few gangs that pass are taken away from the coast. They could, however, easily be stopped by the soldiers if the local official had a wish to do so. It has, however, of late not been found convenient to pass so far north as Dar es Salaam, and slaves are shipped in canoes or small dhows from native villages further north. The numbers, however, so shipped are comparatively small, and could easily be reduced if an active officer were stationed at Dar es Salaam.<sup>57</sup></p> <p>In the latter part of 1884 a famine in Uzaramo led to an overt increase in the slave trade in Dar es Salaam. An interpreter, whom Kirk sent over to investigate the murder of a Banyan, reported that the Wazaramo were living on wild grass, seeds and roots. The inhabitants of one village were kidnapping those of another and fathers were selling their children for food. The interpreter saw over three hundred slaves in the village of Mjimwema. He got wind of the fact that an Arab was shipping twenty-seven slaves to Pemba and informed the Liwali of Dar es Salaam, who, however, acted with such remissness that only one slave was rescued, though the owner was captured.<sup>43</sup> A few days later H.M.S. \u201cPhilomel\u201d seized another dhow at Dar es Salaam with 108 slaves on board.<sup>44</sup> On November 17 the pinnace of H.M.S. \u201cTurquoise\u201d rescued another seven slaves from a dhow in Msasani Bay, but the crew managed to escape.<sup>45</sup> The trade was still being carried on in the following year deep lie the fact that the acute famine was over.<sup>46</sup></p> <p>It was not until the Germans took over Dar es Salaam from the Sultan of Zanzibar, and effectively occupied the adjacent hinterland, that the last of the Arab slave traders was overthrown and the overseas traffic in slaves was destroyed.</p> <p>The fourth edition of the Indian Ocean Directory (p. 594) describes Dar es Salaam as it was in 1882 in the following words:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>The palace of the Sultan is completed, and is the westernmost house on ine bank. A flagstaff stands in front... The remainder of the stone buildings, with two exceptions, are roofless, and look more like ruined houses than uncompleted ones, en account of the vegetation which climbs round them. There is, however, a considerable population living in the mud huts around those ruins, and the village of Mjimwema may be said to be part of Dar es Salaam. There is a governor, with a guard of the Sultan\u2019s soldiers, and a customs-house official.</p> <p>A large tract of land at the back is planted with coconuts, belong- ing to the Sultan, and will bring in no inconsiderable revenue in a few years. There is already a little trade with the interior, caravans of ivory occasionally arriving for shipment to Zanzibar. A road is in course of construction for wheeled traffic between the town and the north end of Lake Nyasa....</p> <p>There are several good wells. The best and most convenient is in the Sultan\u2019s grounds at the back of his palace. There is another at the mosque close to a small house with a dome, but there is some difficulty about boats filling their barricoes there, though it is outside the mosque wall. A third is at a Banyan\u2019s house, some way inland to the N.E. The well, which is most conveniently situated close to the beach, in the bank to the East of the unfinished buildings, should be carefully avoided.\u201d</p> <p>On February 23, 1886, Dar es Salaam was visited by Colonel (afterwards Field Marshal Earl) Kitchener and his French and German colleagues on the International Commission for delimitation of the boundaries of the Sultan of Zanzibar\u2019s mainland dominions. At that date the town had a population of five thousand. Of these 107 were Indians (45 Bohoras, 14 Hindus and 47 Khojas). Another hundred were members. of the Arab garrison and there were also 600 or 700 slaves working on the Sultan\u2019s plantations.</p> <p>The town was in charge of a Wali, named Muhammad bin Suleiman El Haruni, an Arab of Muscat, who had at that date held the post for four years. He laid claim to the exercise of jurisdiction over the tribes in the hinterland to a distance of one month\u2019s march from Dar es Salaam but, as further interrogation showed that he was surprisingly ignorant of the chiefs and peoples of those countries, that claim must be considerably discounted. He stated that on the previous day people had come from Ras Kimbiji, about 25 miles S.E. of Dar es Salaam, to obtain his adjudication on a matter of inheritance, \u2018and that he would cause to be arrested any party who should refuse to submit to his judgment.\u201d He also informed the Commission that there were six to seven \u201cimportant natives\u2019, who lived on plantations several hours\u2019 march inland, \u201cwho go each year to Zanzibar to pay a visit to the Sultan.\u201d</p> <p>The Customs Master at Dar es Salaam was a Hindu, named Bhanji Wadowji, who, to judge from the answers he gave to the Commission, was a gentleman of sedentary habits. He stated that:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>The only places under his orders outside of Dar es Salaam are the customs-houses of Magogoni, Mboamaji, and Tuliani; he states he may have customs-houses between Mboamaji and Kisiju, but he does not know of them and he does not know of any person at Dar es Salaam who would give this information.</p> <p>He had visited Magogoni and Tuliani, but he has not been to Mboamaji. He does not know if there is a customs-house at Msasani; he says perhaps there are customs-houses there but these two places belong to Bagamoyo.</p> <p>Ivory comes in greater abundance to Dar es Salaam than to these other places, which, however, on the other hand receive more merchandise, but he says the result is pretty well the same for all the customs houses.\u201d<sup>58</sup></p> <p>The future of Dar es Salaam had, however, been settled long before the Commission began its work. In August, 1885, a German naval squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Knorr proceeded to Zanzibar to obtain a commercial treaty from the Sultan and also recognition by him of the protectorates which the German Emperor claimed over certain territories in the interior of Africa by virtue of a number of treaties which Carl Peter and certain other Germans professed to have made with the local rulers. With six German warships anchored in front of his palace at Zanzibar Seyyid Barghash had no choice in the matter and perforce yielded with the best grace he could. This was followed by a letter from Admiral Knorr to the Sultan asking for the use of Dar es Salaam as a German naval base \u201cfrom the friendship of Your Highness on behalf of my Government.\u201d \u2018Once again, Seyyid Barghash could not choose but hear and made the best of the situation by offering to place at the disposal of the German Government the buildings and space necessary for the navy\u2019s purposes on shore<sup>47</sup>.</p> <p>A photograph of Dar es Salaam, which was taken by a German photographer from the harbour and which was reproduced in 1894 in Stuhlmann\u2019s Mit Emin Pascha ins Herz von Afrika suggests that outwardly the place was much the same at that date as it was when Captain Sulivan took his photograph over twenty years before. Nevertheless, according to what Captain Leue tells us it was but a whited sepulchre when he landed there cn May 25 1887. \u201cThe place and its port were desolate...... All the streets were overgrown with grass and bush and the individual groups of houses were joined by native paths only.... In the halls of the Sultan\u2019s palace lived bats, and castor oil plants were rampant in its walled garden. Part of the palace was used as a gaol.\u201d<sup>48</sup>.</p> <p>As Elton wrote in 1874, \u201chad the original plans of the founder, Seyyid Majid, been carried out in their full integrity, he would have left a model settlement behind him in the Mrima.\u201d<sup>49</sup>. It was no fault of the founder that those plans were never carried out in full. The idea showed that Majid. like his father Seyyid Said, was a man of considerable vision and, had his life been prolonged, his plans might have come much nearer to fruition than they did. History, however, proved that his plan, like that of the Mackinnon Road, was prematurely born, but neither his name nor those of the promoters of that later scheme should be entirely forgotten. Amid obstacles and difficulties, which it is hard for this modern age to appreciate, they made their contribution to the advancement of the prosperity and well being of the peoples of Tanganyika.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-01/#authorities","title":"AUTHORITIES.","text":"<p>S.T.\u2014Correspondence respecting the Slave Trade.</p> <p>T.N.R.\u2014Tanganyika Notes and Records.</p> <p>Z.A.\u2014Zanzibar Archives.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-01/#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>View Original PDF</p> <ol> <li> <p>Stuhlmann\u2014Beitrage zur Kulturgeschiechte van Ostafrika p. 855.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Baker\u2014Note on the Washomvi of Dar es Salaam, T.N.R. 23 p. 47.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Velten\u2014M\u00e9rchen und Erzahlungen der Swaheli.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Stuhlmann\u2014Mit Emin Pascha ins Herz von Afrika p. 34.

Cory","text":"<p>The Lake Province covers a land area of about 39,000 square miles and has a population of one million eight hundred thousand. As far as population is concerned it is by far the largest province in the territory. There are few records of what the country was like in pre-European days, but it seems clear that it was overgrown with bush, in some areas heavy and in some areas light. An early explorer wrote that the Sukuma drive their cattle into the forest during the dry season. It was everywhere sparsely populated. The scattered human colonies consisted of a hundred odd people under the leadership of an Ntemi, a name which only later became the title of a chief. Kutema means to cut down trees in the bush, and shows that the Batemi of this time were true pioneers who opened up the country and retained the leadership of their followers, who were mainly members of their own family.</p> <p>The various settlements had little communication with each other and had no conception of tribal unity. The Batemi never thought of enlarging the areas under their influence except for the sake of increasing the huntingground for their people. But these men were not only hunters. Even at that time, before the arrival of the Hamitic invaders, the Bantu tilled their fields and drove their cattle to pasture. Hunting, however, was from all points of view an important activity. It was necessary to protect the fields in the bush against marauding game and to provide additional meat for the pot, and later to obtain ivory for trading.</p> <p>It may be because of the isolation of the separate settlements that the form of marriage by abduction, traces of which can still be found here and there in the marriage customs, was widespread.</p> <p>I have mentioned the Bantu, which is not of course the name of a certain race, but of a very big language group.,Now the Bantu are themselves immigrants and are amixed people. Sir Harry Johnston thinks that somewhereto the South of Lake Chad the indigenous people came into contact with Hamitic groups. The resultant mixed people migrated to the east and crossed over to the Elgon area, where, even now, live people who speak a very ancient dialect\u2014Lugishu. From there they spread to the south and back to the east in the Lake region. These people are the Bantu.</p> <p>Many theories have been advanced in support of the supposition that the Lake region was one of the first areas to be inhabited by the Bantu. Professor Warmelo, who tried to enlist the aid of linguistic science to help in the solution of ethnological problems, advanced the following theory: Words which are common to a great number of Bantu languages and dialects must be old, that is to say they have been used by people who were the ancestors of younger tribes. The meaning of such very old words should allow a conclusion to be made about the manner of life, about common animals and plants, about foodstuffs and implements and arts and crafts the word Nyanja, Nyanza, Nyassa\u2014Lake\u2014from which comes Ngwa with which the people were familiar. He drew attention to the fact that Nyanza\u2014to the Lake\u2014contracted to Mwanza, is found in many Bantu languages. It does not mean water or river\u2014it means lake. Common to many languages also is the root ato, meaning canoe, and kapi, meaning paddle. The root twa, meaning pigmy is also widespread and shows that these Ur-Bantu knew the aboriginal inhabitants of Africa.</p> <p>For reasons which we do not know, thousands of years ago people in the North of Africa began to emigrate to the south. The progress was slow and it is, for instance, said that the Masai arrived four to five hundred years ago at the Rift Valley.</p> <p>These people were Hamites; their home the Gala area in Abyssinia. There is a theory that some of these nomadic cattle-breeders were forced into their southern journey by the gradual drying up of the Sahara desert at a certain period. This emigration brought the Bantu into contact with the Hamites a second time, and this is perhaps one of the most important features of their history because, as Professor Seligman states: \u201cThe history of Africa south of the Sahara is no more than the story of the permeation through the ages, in different degrees and at different times, of the negro and bushman aborigines by Hamitic blood and culture. The Hamites were, in fact, the great civilizing force of black Africa from a relatively early period.\u201d</p> <p>The entrance gate of the Lake Province for the Hamitic immigrants was Bukoba, and they probably arrived there about three hundred and fifty years ago. They were Bahima, also called Bahuma or Batusi. The ruling family in Bunyoro was of Hamitic origin and a scion of this dynasty enter- ed the Bukoba area with a group of followers. He was Ruhinda, one of those figures in African history who have become the source of many legends and who are not now thought of as mortals but enjoy the veneration given to deities, although they are not members of any celestial hierarchy. Ruhinda gave his name to the ruling class of Bukoba, the Bahinda. The Hinda invasion was in the main peaceful.</p> <p>Ruhinda held sway over the south-west and south coast of Lake Victoria as far as Smith Sound. There is 4 legend that at the time of his death Thangiro and Uzinza both wanted to bury him in their country, and each side pulled so hard at the body that it broke in half and each half was buried in the country of the party gaining it. Another legend has it that his body was cut up into five pieces and one piece was buried in each of his five dominions as a solution of the dispute between them about the place of burial. The head was taken to Karagwe, the two arms to Kiziba, one leg to Kiamtwara and the other to Ihangiro. The trunk was buried in Uzinza on the Lake shore in Ruhinda\u2019s village of Kimwani.</p> <p>There is an uninterrupted line of descent of the Bukoba chiefs from Ruhinda to the present day. Kiziba has its own history of origin; it is, however, connected with the Hinda family. The Bahinda are now a very big family and many of its members are just common peasants.</p> <p>Biharamulo is a big district and the area is characteristic of many parts of Africa. Ample spaces, totally undeveloped, scarcely populated and infested with glossina of all kinds, which means sleeping sickness and rinderpest. For this reason the population is assembled in \u201cconcentrations.\u201d The inhabitants represent a connecting link between the Lacustrians, the tribes living between the Lakes, and the Rundi group of tribes. Their ruling dynasty is of Hima origin. When the Germans arrived in that part of the country in about 1889 they found there Kasasura\u2014a very powerful chief who made such an impression on Count G\u00f6tzen, a German officer, that the latter recommended the building of a strong fortification, which still stands, the walls now tending to lean perilously outward. Each D.C. in succession now leaves as monument to his period of office one or more buttresses to reinforce the tottering glory of the past.</p> <p>In Bugufi live the Bahangaza, who are Barundi, as likewise are the inhabitants of Busubi, the second chiefdom comprising the district of Ngara. The rulers\u2019 family came from Urundi and is of Hima or Tusi stock.</p> <p>The Bahangaza are ethnographically so completely Barundi that a Rundi chief recently though fit to claim Bagufi as part of his country. The claim was laid before the United Nations, who decided to investigate it. The people of Bugufi unanimously, and in an impressive form, gave it to be understood that they would never agree to change British Administration for Belgian. As even on historical grounds the claim was very shaky, the final decision in this matter followed the will of the people. The Bahangaza are a very quiet people, not many of them literate, and their standard of living is low. Their main income comes from labouring in Uganda, whither every year a considerable percent of the male population migrates. But when it came to the vital question of which European power should be in charge they realized the importance of the issue and became articulate and firm.</p> <p>Passing back through Biharamulo and rounding the Emin Pasha Gulf, we enter Uzinza. Emin Pasha was, as is generally known, an Austrian at one time in the service of the German Government, and sent to occupy this country He was for a time resident at Bukoba and he was responsible for making it possible for everyone to grow coffee. He laid out a big coffee nursery near Bukoba and he distributed the young plants among cultivators. The planting of coffee had been for centuries the prerogative of the chiefs, who gave away seedlings, rather as medals are given, to deserving favourites.</p> <p>Coffee is indigenous to Africa and has been known since very ancient times, not as a beverage but as a very sustaining food. The Gala and others took with them on their raids balls made of raw ground coffee mixed with ghee as iron rations. It is said that a ball the size of a billiard ball could sustain a man for a day. Because of its use, raids on distant tribes depended on the possession of coffee, and so leaders, and later the Bukoba chiefs, reckoned coffee to be part of their armaments.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The Bazinza are related to the Bahaya, were under Hinda rule, and colonized only the shore area of the Lake. The hinterland did not interest them. It is now of great interest to the Sukuma Federation, to which the Zinza chiefdoms belong, and about which I will soon have more to say.</p> <p>We next cross Smith Sound, which is presumed to have been named after a certain Lieutenant Shergold Smith, the leader of a missionary expedition to the Lake area in 1877. During this expedition Lieutenant Smith carried out a survey of the Sound on which Mwanza is built. He was subsequently murdered on Ukerewe Island by the men of Chief Lakonge, the ruler of that area.</p> <p>From Smith Sound we enter Sukumaland proper. I recently read an cold book. \u201cNew Light on Dark Africa,\u201d in which the author, Karl Peters, writes: \u201cThe Basukuma exhibit the characteristics of the dwellers in marshy plains. They are heavy and sleepy, but, as it appears, reliable and steady.\u201d I think that this is not a bad judgment, especially as I feel that they have woken up since then.</p> <p>Along the same road on which I have brought you from Uzinza to Usukuma came the Hima, whose descendants now rule over the greater number of the Sukuma chiefdoms. While the group of Lacustrians living north and west of Lake Victoria has for many hundred years formed and retained a number of kingdoms, the best known being Buganda, Bunyoro and Karagwe the group living south of Lake Victoria has never built up an empire. But the immigrants from the north, mainly from Bunyoro, being well acquainted with the idea of powerful and extensive kingdoms, fundamentally influenced the political structure of the area. The immigrating families established authority over sections of the existing population and came to rule over them. The Hamitic element has been wholly absorbed, however, and only faint traditions remain to tell of the historical events of the invasion.</p> <p>There is no strict conception of a common tribal name for the people living in the area from Shinyanga to Lake Victoria and between Smith Sound and the Mbalangeti river. The Word \u201cSukuma,\u201d now generally used as a tribal name for the inhabitants, in their own language means \u201cnorth.\u201d The Basukuma, together with the Nyamwezi-speaking peoples living south of Usukuma, comprise the Sukuma-Nyamwezi language group which has in common not only language but also many other ethnic characteristics. Travellers passing through Nyamwezi countries were probably informed about the country of \u201csukuma\u2019\u201d\u2014the country to the north\u2014and so the name came to be generally adopted. The Basukuma of the Lake area proper call themselves Bagwe and their language Kigwe, but this name is not used frequently and some people say that it has been given to them by their neighbours.</p> <p>As a result of the non-existence of a common tribal name the subjects or the Sukuma chiefdoms adopted the clan names of their rulers as their specific tribal names. The most important among the immigrating families of Hamitic origin were the Bazinza, Basiha, Bakwimba, Bagero and Basega. Many contradictory stories exist about their early history, their adventurous travels and their conquest of Sukumaland. Almost every Sukuma chiefdom has its own tradition which tends to increase the importance of the first arrivals and to compete thus with chiefdoms ruled by other branch lines of the same family. Generally it can be stated that the leading members of these families were not military conquerors. They did not arrive with numerous followers and they were obviously accepted as leaders by common consent, as no major fights are related as occurring between them and the people they found living in the country. It seems that, at the very time of their arrival, the country, which had been originally very sparsely populated, became sufficiently consolidated to make a common leadership for groups of isolated settlements desirable. These immigrants offered many advantages as leaders. They were ideal judges because they were totally unbiased, as they belonged to none of the local clans. For the same reason they were also the best arbitrators for a just distribution of the spoils of the chase and of clan warfare. They may also have impressed the indigenous population with superior mental and physical qualities.</p> <p>It may be that a large part of Usukuma has had a comparatively peaceful history. Although inter-tribal wars were frequent, they were not very bloody and sometimes a few accidents, not necessarily connected with warfare, sufficed to bring the battle to an end. From outside there was little menace, and therefore you see in north and middle Usukuma a type of scattered settlement most convenient for the peasant, with his fields close to his hut, whereas, in the south, raids by the Masai and more serious inter-tribal wars menaced the people, who reacted by living in close settlements.</p> <p>As a result of the favourable conditions of a comparatively dense and widespread population, many indigenous institutions can be found here. Hardly anywhere else are the religious features of ancestor worship so elaborate as they are in Sukumaland. It is not so much the rites which are exceptionally elaborate. As far as these are concerned other tribes have created more impressive ceremonies. It is the actual organisation of the religious cult which is a special Sukuma achievement. We have here two societies, Bafumu and Bumanga, to one or both of which almost every Sukuma belongs. Their sole purpose is to regulate the features of the cult of ancestor worship, the basic religious beliefs of the Sukuma, and, for that matter, of all Bantu. For instance, novices are instructed as to what medium for soothsaying is preferable to any other. It is a common feature that magic and medical knowledge are closely connected with the religious aspect of life.</p> <p>Besides the Bafumu and Bumanga, concerned with ancestor worship and soothsaying, since ancient times secret societies of snake-charmers, porcupine-hunters, and elephant-hunters have thrived in this area. Although \u201che origin of these is not always found in Sukumaland or in Unyamwezi, they were able to form their biggest organisations and most lively inter-society connections here.</p> <p>Since the Banyamwezi, who are so closely related to the Basukuma, were the first to be employed as porters on the great Bagamoyo\u2014Tabora\u2014Ujiji trade route, the Basukuma were called, and called themselves until recent times, Banyamwezi as soon as they left their own country. They have been and still are very good workers. They made contact with very many other tribes. When European agricultural enterprises were started they became a very valued labour force in the camps. Today groups of them are frequently found near the big estates, living on their own land and still working for the Europeans. Sometimes they have become detribalized and supply the markets with the produce of their fields. Everywhere one or another member of the Sukuma tribal group has preserved the manifold knowledge of his fathers and practices a little medicine here and a little magic there, or is popular as a diviner.</p> <p>Before we come to Musoma, I must mention the Ukerewe or Bukerewe Island, as it really should be called. It is inhabited by a mixture of tribes. The island is thickly populated by roughly equal proportions of Bakerewe, Bakara (who have their own island a few miles to the north) and Bajita who also inhabit an overcrowded chiefdom on the mainland just inside the Musoma District. All three tribes have a tradition of having come at a not very distant date from Bukoba District, and there is every reason to believe this to be true. The three languages are so similar to the Luhaya tongue that the people of Ukerewe have little difficulty in understanding the speech of the Bukoba natives. The chiefs are Bahinda.</p> <p>The island of Ukara is about eight miles north of Ukerewe. The people immigrated there from Bukoba, where the inhabitants of the chiefdom of Maruku are still known as Bakara, though the smartly dressed young men from Maruku deny relationship with the sack-clothed Bakara dock laborers on the wharf at Mwanza.</p> <p>In the Musoma District live the Bajita, already mentioned, the Ikizu Shashi, Zanaki, Ikoma and Nguruimi. All these tribes have a dash of Hamitic or Nilotic blood in them. The Hamitic Taturu (other names for these people are Tatoga and Wamangati) were numerous in this area. Baumann, from whom the Baumann Gulf takes its name, and who was the leader of an expedition in 1896 or thereabouts, found them still near the Lake shores, whence they have now completely disappeared.</p> <p>The broad Mara river divides the Musoma District from the North Mara District. In the latter live the Luo and Girango who are Nilotic, the Kuria who are of Bantu-Nilo-Hamitic origin and the Suba who are ethnologically between the two.</p> <p>The Kuria are Masai who emigrated into their present habitat about eleven generations ago. They settled down\u2014for reasons unknown\u2014to a peasant life, giving up the nomadic habits of their forefathers. They retained some of the Masai spirit\u2014the love of cattle and great zeal in acquiring them, and an independent character.</p> <p>Before I leave the African population of the Lake Province I would like to say a few words about the original social structure. From the west to the east the authority of chiefs diminishes, from absolutism in Bukoba through a milder form of absolutism slightly controlled by democratic institutions in Sukumaland, to the substitution of councils of elders for chiefs among the Kuria.</p> <p>Now we come to the more recent history of this big area, which is fairly well known because many of the first European explorers passed through one part or another of the Lake Province. Speke discovered the Lake in 1858 during his famous expedition with Burton. Stanley passed several times through this region and had trouble with the inhabitants of Bumbiri Island, on the Bukoba coast, of which no tradition whatever could be found by later explorers! Speke and Grant, on another expedition, passed through Karagwe on their journey to Mutesa, the notorious Kabaka of Uganda, and lived \u201cfor several months at Rumanika\u2019s court. Dr. Junker, the famous Russian explorer spent six days in Msalala in 1886. A German lieutenant, Kollmann, wrote the first monograph about this part of the Lake and the inhabitants of its shores in 1899. The book is called \u201cVictoria Nyanza.\u201d Another old book is that of H. Rehse, a German Sergeant-Major. It is called \u201cKiziba\u201d and the co-author of it was Mwami Lwamgira, the notable Mhaya.</p> <p>The first Church Missionary Society station to be opened in this area was at Buzilima at the south end of Smith Sound. The history of the Church Missionary Society relates how in November, 1882, the Reverend E. C. Gordon, Mr. C. Wise and others reached Buzilima. The old chief, Chasama, who only died recently, had very interesting stories to tell of the arrival of these early missionaries. Most of the party pushed on to Uganda, but Gordon and Wise remained and started to build the mission station. The famous Missionary, A. M. Mackay, joined them in 1887 and a new station was built twelve miles to the north of the old one, the hostile attitude of the chief and various inhabitants having made the station at Buzilima intolerable. The short life of this Mission station came to an end in 1890 with the death of Mackay. The work was continued at other stations, including Nassa, but the Busambiro station was abandoned and has never keen revived. The graves of Mackay, Parker, Blackburn, Hunt and Dunn, who all died there during this brief period, can still be seen near the ruins of the Mission. The work of the Church Missionary Society in the Sukuma area was taken over by the Africa Inland Mission in 1909.</p> <p>The White Fathers Mission started from Zanzibar via Bagamoyo, and the first caravan arrived at the Lake in 1876, the ultimate goal of the safari being Buganda. There they settled first and from there in 1882 they returned to the southern shores of the Lake. They did not leave Buganda voluntarily, but had to escape because of the persecutions of Kabaka Mutesa.</p> <p>They selected Bukumbi in the Smith Sound area as a suitable spot for a mission station. Shortly afterwards they opened up a second station in Nyegezi. This later station was, however, soon closed down. It was situated on the Lake shore and proved unhealthy. The present Nyegezi Missionwas built in 1929 and 1930. From Bukumbi the White Fathers went to Ukerewe in 1895, and during the next decade to Bukoba and many other places in the Lake Province.</p> <p>The name Bukumbi, meaning \u201cthe place of beads,\u201d was not, as many people think, derived from the rosaries worn by the White Fathers. It was so named because a pot of beads was unearthed there long before the arrivalof the White Fathers.</p> <p>Less peaceful was the entrance of the White Fathers into Bukerewe, where the boat with missionaries was received with a hail of poisoned arrows. They had to retreat, but finally they succeeded in coming ashore at another spot where the people had run away at their approach.</p> <p>The importance of all these mission stations at the time when the country was not yet pacific can only be realised if one reads the reports of the old travellers. The missions were the outposts of European civilization. They soon became places where the natives did not run away from or fight a European as soon as they saw him.</p> <p>For the Africans the beneficial activity of all missions, setting aside the religious aspect, cannot be better described than by mentioning the names of the hospitals at Kagondo. Sumve. Kolondoto, Shirati and the first primary schools at Katoke and Ihungu.</p> <p>Europeans were not the first strange races to enter the country. Many years before they arrived there were Arab traders living in Usukuma and in Bukoba, where the now completely depopulated area of Kafulu in Karagwe was a prosperous trading centre with caravans bringing cloth and beads and taking back ivory. Ivory was the one commodity which was readily accepted by the traders in barter for powder and guns. Any chief in possession of a sufficient number of muzzle loaders could consider himself safe from aggression in tribal wars. Therefore ivory had to be delivered to the chief, just as now it has to be delivered to the Government.</p> <p>The slave trade did not flourish here as it did on other trade routes. I like to think that the slave traders spared this country because of the good defence put up against it by the inhabitants.</p> <p>The Arab penetration has left its mark on the country, and in various trading centres, especially in Sukumaland, Arabs, often descendants of the old pioneers, carry on their tradition and help to develop the country. Wherever there is a possibility of growing anything the Arabs have created little oases of fruit trees, and the greatest pride of a white-bearded patriarch is to have a few vines forming a shady pergola.</p> <p>When the country began to be opened un the Indian traders started to share the trade with the Arabs. They had arrived long before at the coast mainly at Zanzibar and Bagamoyo, where they helped to fit out the expeditions of all the big explorers. Probably the reason for the later arrival of the Indian merchants in the interior is to be found in the form of bussiness which they preferred. They were mainly importers and exporters of goods on a large scale, or they bought wholesale from European importers and they only sent their agents into the interior for retail trading. Their greatest progress was made after the railway was constructed.</p> <p>Mwanza early became an important trading centre. A photograph taken in 1904 shows a great settlement with clearly a considerable African population and in 1910 there were said to be 90 Europeans in the town.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-02/#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>View Original PDF</p> <ol> <li> <p>Cf.

According to the elders the custom is observed by the Washenzi, i.e. the aborigines who are now Muslims; the Arabs do not participate though I seem to remember seeing some of the younger African-born Arabs joining the Swahilis in their annual bathe at Pangani. The washing is now regarded as a sign of joy at the advent of the new year but is really a ceremonial cleansing of the body in order to wipe out the old year and its trouble. Strictly speaking sadaka (alms) must be distributed on that day and new fires lighted in every house.</p> <p>The interesting point is that the bathing takes place on the first day of a year containing three hundred and sixty-five days or, according to Muslim computation, eleven days later each year. My original note was made in 1933 and in that year the Kuoga Mwaka took place on the 5th of Mfunguo Saba; the next year on the 16th and the following year on the 27th of the same month. There seems little doubt that the coastal population used calendar months until conversion to Islam caused them to adopt the system in vogue among the Arabs.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-03/#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>View Original PDF</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/","title":"The Tatoga of Tanganyika","text":""},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/#part-one","title":"PART ONE","text":""},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/#g-mcl-wilson","title":"G.

INTRODUCTION","text":"<p>This paper has been written to provide a peg upon which to hang future papers and publications on the Barabaig and other Tatoga groups in Tanganyika. Here I am giving the barest outline of the ecological distributions of the Tatoga and a brief description of their physical environment, migration complex, and tribal organization. The major emphasis will be on the Barabaig among whom I have lived for nearly two years. The other Tatoga groups were very briefly visited but it is hoped that sometime in the future it will be possible to spend more time with each of these groups. The final section is concerned with Barabaig murders and should prove of interest to readers in Tanganyika.</p> <p>There is very little published material to be found on the Tatoga apart from several short articles in unavailable German periodicals and a brief article in Tanganyika Notes and Records by C. H.N. Jackson, Ph.D. A comprehensive bibliography of works mentioning the Tatoga of Tanganyika is included at the end of the paper.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/#origins","title":"Origins.","text":"<p>The language of the Tatoga groups has been classified by Huntingford<sup>1</sup> and others as Nilo-Hamitic and of the Nandi type. There is no doubt about the fact that Tatoga were living in the Mount Elgon region some two hundred and fifty years ago, but whether they were Nandi people who had been separated from Nandi for centuries or people of a common generic stock to the Nandi, Kipsigis and Masai, who left the Mount Elgon area in face of the Nandi invasion, I am not prepared to say \u00e9xcept that, at the moment, I strongly favour the latter explanation. That they lived on Mount Elgon is proved by a myth which is common to at least three of the sub-tribes to the effect that they inhabited a high mountain from which they could see two large bodies of water (i.e. Lake Victoria and Lake Rudolf). This place was called the land of the rivers and elephants or, in the vernacular, Endabesht. There is a place to be found today called Endabess which was inhabited, say the Nandi, by the Sirikwa. \u201cThese people were like the Nandi but not completely Nandi in language and customs and they suddenly disappeared leaving only a small group who became completely assimilated,\u201d goes the story of my Nandi informant, Chief Isaiah Keina, at Kapsabet, Kenya. He and his mother are both des- cendants of the Sirikwa who remained.</p> <p>There is no doubt about the numerous words in the two languages, Tatoga and Nandi, which are identical but on the other hand there are many linguistical differences of a structural nature which could hardly have occurred within so short a period. Masculine and feminine nouns are found, for example, in Nandi but not in Tatoga. The word order, tense structure, and formation of plurals are different. In any case language is a highly suspect criterion of common origin, especially if it is not backed up by cultural and other data.</p> <p>The age-sets of the Nandi and Kipsigis can be compared easily to those of the Masai whilst those of the Tatoga are so different that to call them age-grades would only confuse the reader. It is better to refer to them as generation names. These named generation groups did have limited functions in time of war but certainly not on the organised scale or efficient system of the Masai and Nandi age-sets. A generation name. of the Tatoga, forms an exogamous horizontal group in that society and this is its chief function. That a generation group of this nature should have evolved in a purely pastoral society is consistent with their form of social organisation and I hope to make this a thesis for a future monograph on the Barabaig to be published in a journal concerned with anthropological theory.</p> <p>The circumcision ceremonies are different between the two groups but it is doubted whether they have always been so. Today, or rather in the recent past, the Nandi circumcised on the Masai pattern which demands unflinching courage of the youths. The Barabaig boy, on the other hand, is expected to make as much noise as possible to solicit the aid of the ancestors, male and female, to help him through the ordeal. There is a picture in Hollis\u2019s \u201cNandi\u201d facing page 52 (plate xxi) of a Nandi boy who had recently been circumcised. This picture could be a Barabaig boy holding the traditional thorn switch during the period of licence and freedom he enjoys after circumcision. These boys are known as mudamujek and the switch is called wapkant. The wapkant is used to demand favours from the young women of the tribe. The Nandi elders questioned, however, professed not to know why the Nandi boy was holding the switch, or its name, when shown the picture.</p> <p>One striking similarity was found in the attitude to iron working. The Nandi in the recent past and the Barabaig today rely for iron work on a special clan or sub-tribe, the Gidanwodik.<sup>2</sup> The avoidances of the ironmaker\u2019s tools, his person, his house and his daughters are found to be the same in both societies, although these avoidances have been overlooked in recent years by the Nandi. Further, the Gidanwodik marry endogamously whereas all other clans marry exogamously. Perhaps it is best to regard them as a sub-tribe although, unlike other sub-tribes, they have no territorial identification.</p> <p>Another similarity is the clan of rainmakers, the Ghowu in Nandi, the Ghowok in Barabaig. These two clans, the Gidanwodik and Ghowok, were found in every one of the Tatoga groups which I visited with the exception of the Salagwajek at Salawe who are completely Sukuma-ized. The Daremajek clan, which is the medicine clan, is also found throughout Tanganyika but was not known in Nandi.</p> <p>There were many similarities found among the terminology for cattle. In both Nandi and Tatoga the word samoi means a brindle-coloured animal and samoient in Nandi is the plural, samohent is the plural in Barabaig and is also the name of one of the largest clans, meaning, the people who came with brindle cattle.</p> <p>Politically many terms were found to be the same in Tatoga and Nandi. The names for the recognised leader of a clan council girwach (B) and girwach (N); the name for the council, girgwageit is the same, as is njogot</p> <p></p> <p>Barabaig maidens wearing only the cloak. Notice the exceptionally fine beadwork. There are at least three hundred shillings worth of beads worn by the girl in the foreground; each row of white beads is alternated by a row of red ones. The red does not stand out well in the photograph.</p> <p>(B), njogeit (N), the name of the fine imposed by the clan elders on a member. The Nandi today call their chief girgwagir, which means in Barabaig, the speaker in a clan or other council, the Barabaig have borrowed the Sukuma word, mutemi(t) or mtemit.</p> <p>The words used for the parts of the body both for animals and humans are very closely related. The hump ukta (N) and huck\u2019t (B), of a bullock sacrificed on any special occasion is eaten by the most important elder of the clan in both societies. The name for the part eaten, the centre portion, is gigwengwen (N) and gigwengwesind (B).</p> <p>There are, however, several words common to both but with significant differences in meaning. One such word is lugeit, which means warriors in Nandi, and lugweig, the enemy, in Barabaig. Another is the term gargweit which in Nandi means an old woman, in Barabaig, a venerable old man. Kinship terminology is purely descriptive in Tatoga but classificatory in Nandi.</p> <p>So much for similarities and differences between Tatoga and Nandi. The fact is apparent from linguistic and cultural material that they are of the same basic stock and that they were formerly in contact with each other. This writer hesitates to say more, but it is understood that Mr. G. W. B. Huntingford will shortly be publishing a monograph on the Nilo-Hamitic groups in Kenya and Tanganyika and it is hoped that he will throw more light on the ancient migrations of these interesting people. It must be made clear, however, that the Barabaig are definitely not Jaluo as stated by Father Crazzolara in his recent work on the Luo.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/#general-characteristics","title":"General Characteristics","text":"<p>What is to follow on general characteristics, appearance, temperament, nutrition, house types, etc., applies to all of the sub-tribes except those at Salawe, Itigi and Muhalala, where the Tatoga have married Bantu wives for generations. In other areas intermarriage has taken place but not on anything like the same scale.</p> <p>The appearance of the Barabaig varies greatly as it does among most people; some are tall, some are short, some are thin, some are fat. Their skin colour ranges from black through light brown to bronze. One is struck with a \u201ctype,\u201d however, which one usually describes when asked what these people look like. The typical Barabaig is tall, muscular and well developed. I am five feet and eleven inches tall and a goodly number of Barabaig males are taller than I and many women approach my height. There are a few exceptionally tall men measuring six feet and three inches or more and the occasional individual at five feet. Average women, I should estimate, range between five feet and five inches to five feet and seven inches, whereas the average male ranges between five feet and nine inches to five feet and eleven inches.</p> <p>The Barabaig are a cattle people and consequently the average standard of nutrition is comparatively high. Unlike most Tanganyika peoples, their diet is notably high in animal protein, blood and milk being the chief food supplemented by meat from sheep, goats, cattle and game. This was their sole diet until comparatively recently. Even today a goodly proportion of the Barbaig do not depend in the least on maize, although they are increasingly developing the taste for it. No medical research, to my knowledge, has ever been carried out among these people. Therefore it is difficult to say accurately whether their standard of health compares favourably or unfavourably with surrounding peoples. Apart from a supposedly high incidence of venereal diseases there have not been any epidemics recently of the more common contagious diseases nor a high incidence of illness. Bubonic plague hit one area in November, 1951, and forty-six people died before it was brought under control. This, however, has little to do with nutrition.</p> <p>I have accurate figures of a one hundred percent sample of the Barabaig homesteads in a border area which reveal that the one hundred or more married women living there, had borne over six hundred children between them, of whom over three hundred had died. This high figure of infant mortality is due, I feel, more to habits of personal hygiene than to nutrition. An actual statistically accurate breakdown would certainly reveal more. My sample was one hundred percent and therefore included women just married, in their teens, and others ready for the grave.</p> <p>It is difficult to discuss habits of dress and personal hygiene from our ethnocentric point of view. The first reaction of most Europeans is that the Barabaig women smell. They do\u2014it is because the animal skins with which they clothe themselves are cured in urine, preferably that from a pregnant woman. A well-made Barabaig cloak and skirt, however, would be admired by the finest Parisian houses of fashion or by Christian Dior himself\u2014apart from the smell. These garments are also practical, they shed the rain well and they are warm and protect the individual from the high wind which blows at near gale force for several months of the year. When working, the women strip to the waist, the men simply strip. Unmarried women of all ages do not wear the skirt, only the cloak, but it is unusual to see either males or females of any age stark naked away from their homestead unless, of course, the men are working the wells or cutting trees. The men wear a large sheet of white cotton cloth, hank\u2019t, usually dyed with red.ochre and impregnated with clarified butter. The hank\u2019t, if one is in style, should be capable of completely covering all the anatomy. A well dressed male will wear sixteen yards of thirty-six inch material sewn in such a way to measure four yards by four yards and this is often fringed all around with tassels.</p> <p>Women of the Buradik, Banjut, Iseimajek and Rutageink on the Wembere and Sibiti do not wear the cloak but have taken to wearing a black light cotton cloth, hank\u2019t. Many of these are studded with designs worked into the cloth with small pieces of brass wire. The men also appear to prefer black. The women say that in the old days their grandmothers wore the leather cloak but because of the heat in the vast low-lying plain that they now occupy they have discarded it. Married women still wear the traditional gored leather skirt.</p> <p>Habits of personal hygiene vary greatly among the Barabaig. Some could be grouped among the dirtiest primitive people that I have ever encountered, while others are among the cleanest. I have eaten in some</p> <p></p> <p>Barabaig women are self-possessed, aggressive and independent.</p> <p>homesteads where warm water was first brought to wash face and hands and in others where I was hardly able to eat because of the filth. Again it is possible to generalize by saying that when water is available most Barabaig wash; when it is not, few go to the trouble to make it available.</p> <p>The sanitary habits of the natives are primitive but not as injurious to nealth as among primary agriculturalists who keep animal and human manures tor their farms. Young children learn at an early age that, by their own standard, one should not be seen in the act of defection. They are taught to dig a hole in the ground away from the homestead or footpath and defecate there and then cover it over with earth or twigs. What is injurious to heaith is the habit of keeping all young stock in the women\u2019s hut, where the young children also sleep. Bovine diseases such as ringworm, tuberculosis, and anthrax can be carried in this way and scabies are also common. Consequently a large number of the Barbaig suffer from skin and eye diseases of one kind and another. The spirillum tick is, unfortunately, an uninvited guest of every homestead.</p> <p>Barabaig have been accused of being lazy by both administrative and specialist officers. Their Native Treasury roads are without doubt the worst in the Northern Province, due not so much to laziness, as to the fact that few of them understand how to use a hoe or are used to working with earth. Give them an axe, as on the tsetse bush clearings, and they are outstanding workers. If one could see them on a lion hunt, chasing through scrub\u2018thorn bush for hours in the blazing sun, oblivious of the discomforts of scratches, thorns, antbear holes, and heat; or watering their cattle from wells thirty or more feet deep; it would be difficult then to say that they are lazy. True, they preter to graze their cattle ten miles and back to surface water rather than to use a well a few miles away, but then their women and young boys can do this whereas they are not permitted by custom to work the wells. Furthermore, having to work interferes with the interminable series of councils, beer drinks and festivals which highlights the dry season.</p> <p>Barabaig are amazingly rational, especially as young aduits. They question their traditional ritual values, religious attitudes, and even their lot within their culture. This gives rise to covert under-currents of dissatisfaction and overtly causes continuous tensions, especially about the disparity of wealth, distribution of inheritance and status. The young men and women are aggressive, quick to anger, and if they have been unjustly treated by their own standard, which is not far removed from our own, they are very slow to forget and often as not take matters in their own hands and avenge themselves. Most Barabaig elders have at least one scar and often several on their heads, testifing to their aggressive nature.</p> <p>The Barabaig women are self-possessed, aggressive and independent, I have often talked at great length with an elder only to have his wife tell me afterwards that most of what the old boy told me was lies and she would go on to tell me the truth. The old women, past child-bearing age, have great influence in clan proceedings, especially if they can count a goodly number of descendants. They are often found to have a fount of genealogical and clan knowledge which surpasses many male informants. When they die however, unlike the old and successful men, their spirits have no influence at all on the welfare of the tribe.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/#ii-the-distribution-of-tatoga-ethnic-groups-in-tanganyika","title":"II.

The Nandi say that they were a populous cattle people who suddenly migrated leaving only a small remnant group which has become completely assimilated to Nandi. Chief Isaiah Keina and his mother, of the Kapsabet District, are descendants of this remnant. Chief Isaiah said that in the past his clan were known as sirikwa kap gabandot. In Barabaig this would be stated as: gaban dosh\u2019t gaba sirkwa; meaning, I am from the gate of the clan or sub-tribe Sirikwa. Furthermore, siriki in Barabaig means, old fashioned, or the way of ancestors. An elder, Hena Misai of Itigi, stated definitely that his sub-tribe, the Mangat\u2019k, and another, the Ghumbiek, were originally called the sirikwajek before they \u201cbecame many so divided.\u201d</p> <p>The origin of the word Mangati now comes into question.

Indeed one would not know they were Tatoga apart from the fact that they and the Tatoga say that they are. It is known, however, that their genealogies reveal, in the fourth and fifth ascending generations, Tatoga names. Informants at Salawe told the writer that a former chief, Ntenga Kabelele, in German times made annual pilgrimages to Gidamowsa, the famous old witch doctor who lived at Basotu and who was hanged by the Germans for his political and magical activities. That involved the chief in an annual safari of over two hundred miles for medicines and advice. It is further stated that this chief and his family could speak the Tatoga language. The writer was astonished to hear that the grandson of Gidamowsa, Gidananan, the wealthy present-day leader of the Bajut eimochant at Mangola, Mbulu District, made a visit to Salawe in 1949 to revive interest in his medicines and political direction.

The Gisamajenk were formerly a war-like, thieving sub-tribe who attracted many scattered groups of Tatoga who came to their area for protection. Today they number barely four thousand souls. When the early German explorer, Dr. Fritz Jaeger, [^4] visited the area at the turn of the century they must have made a lasting impression on him by their numbers and physical characteristics. He seems to have spent considerable time among them and took the trouble to describe them in some detail and also to record many photographs. He called them the Wambulu and he scarcely mentioned the Iraqw who have overrun the area.</p> <p>Early German maps refer to this district as the Tatoga Plateau. Today, however, it is almost completely inhabited by the rapidly increasing Iraqw. The last vestige of unity was lost a few years ago when the Gisamajenk chief, Gitageno, was replaced by an Iraqw sub-chief and the Native Treasuries combined. Today the Gisamajenk have not even a headman in an area which was indisputably theirs less than fifty years ago.</p> <p>Furthermore they are being rapidly assimilated by the Iraqw, \u2018most of them are bi-lingual and it is difficult to find a Gisamajenk in the Mbulu District who has not Iraqw blood. Their customs are changing rapidly and with forty years of Mission work among them many are Christians. They still hold to their clan and lineage structure, however, and at the time of writing are making desperate efforts to recover political control of what appears to be a lost cause.</p> <p>It has been said by many informants that the Barabaig broke away from the Gisamajenk fifty to sixty years ago. The myth which explains the separation varies depending on whether the informant is Barabaig or Gisamajenk. However, it is now established that only a small section of Barabaig were formerly Gisamajenk and these were taken in by the bulk of the Barabaig who had complete control of the area known as the Barabaig Steppes, below the escarpment, for the last two hundred and fifty years at least. These Gisamajenk clans can still be identified although they are now regarded as Barabaig.</p> <p>The Gisamajenk, in this writer\u2019s opinion, formed a later migration than the rest of the Tatoga groups and their customs are certainly more in line with Nandi. They were expert bowmen and arrow makers whereas the rest of the Tatoga relied mostly on the spear and stick. Further, their shields were more highly developed and used for fighting, whereas among the rest of the Tatoga the shield was an ineffective defensive weapon and rarely carried in war. Moreover they also had a highly developed knowledge of poisons, which is not found among the rest of the Tatoga. The Gisamajenk have songs describing enemy raids which include the Tatoga among their enemies. Finally they were, as far as can be ascertained, partial cultivators when they came to the area, an aspect of economic mode which is only now beginning among most of the other Tatoga groups.</p> <p>Today many Gisamajenk have left the Dongabesh area and scattered groups are to be found in every other Tatoga sub-tribe apart from that at Salawe.

The migrations</p> <p> <p>of the Tatoga are, however, quite clear over the past two hundred and fifty odd years. Where they came from before that is a matter for speculation and beyond the scope of this paper.</p> <p>Another point which has always interested me is the assumption by anthropologists and others that migrations are necessarily slow whereas several migrations of Tatoga which were observed by this writer were anything but slow. Last year, for example, a group of Barabaig families were burned out of the Hanang area by a bush fire. In less than two days they were settled thirty-six miles away in homesteads which, to the casual observer, might have been there for many years. Many Gisamajenk families were met living among other Tatoga groups several hundred miles from Dongabesh, which journey took them less than ten days.</p> <p>When we say therefore that the Tatoga formerly inhabited the Mount Elgon area of Kenya and left suddenly, it is possible that within a month they were settled peacefully on the slopes of Hanang Mountain in the Mbulu District, which is about five hundred air miles away. The first groups which arrived at Hanang Mountain and grazed into what \u2018was called the Barabaig Steppes by the Germans were Mangat\u2019k and Bianjit. The latter means land or territory. They must have arrived and been well settled before Ruida, a Buradik, the eponymous founder of the largest clans in Barabaig, arrived there about two hundred and fifty years ago. Ruida found the Hanang area already occupied by Tatoga groups of the Bianjit, Daragwajek, Mungat\u2019k, and Ghumbiek who were living among an agricultural people, the Gobreik, the Tatoga name for the Gorowa.</p> <p>Informants state that when their grandfathers were alive the whole of the Barabaig Steppes were fly-free to Itigi and thus the whole area formed by the Eyasi, Sibiti, Itigi, Bubu, Basotu, Hanang and Yaida swamps was used by the Tatoga as grazing. The Bianjit used what is now called Mianji dam, south of Singida, as their permanent dry-season watering point before the lake burst its bank and disappeared fifty or sixty years ago. The Ghumbiek migrated from the Hanang area because of conflict with Ruida and his followers to the Itigi-Manyoni area where they found the Daragwajek already installed. The closely related sub-tribes which are found there today followed them shortly after. They were cut off from the rest of the Tatoga by the encroachment of the fly along what is now the Mbulu-Kondoa, Mbulu-Singida border. The Barabaig within the memory of aged informants enjoyed grazing through to Singida where there was adequate water. Nyangura, the founder of a large and influential clan, Hilbanyangura, regarded what is now Singida as his clan waters: the word Singida is the name of one of his sons who lived there for many years. The honours of this great war chief, Singida, are still sung by the Barabaig in their tribal war songs. His name means zebra, singieida, because he was born on the day a zebra was killed for medicines for his mother.</p> <p>To the north of Hanang the powerful Gisamajenk of Dongabesh regarded their territory as including the eastern shores of Eyasi and Ngorongoro as well as the Yaida and Dongabesh to the escarpment. Several other eimojik lived with them for protection. Groups of the Iseimajek, Bajut, and Buradik were followers of the Gisamajenk until Ghambameid, a son of Ruida, defeated the Gisamajenk at a place called Dabil at the foot of the Mbulu Escarpment. During this battle the group which followed Ghambameid killed all of their enemies who were wounded or captured by beating them with sticks. From that date the followers of Ruida, who were originally Buradik, were known as Barabaig, meaning those who kill with sticks. We are able to place the rough date of Ghambameid by many genealogies which count back ten generations from men in their thirties. Barabaig marry in their late twenties so we can roughly estimate the time of Ghambameid as two hundred and fifty years ago. Ghambameid, unlike Ruida, Salahog, Ghumbangaing, and other mythical ancestors, did exist and his grave is still placated not only by members of his own clan and sub-tribe but also by individual Tatoga from several eimojik. The Tatoga groups at Itigi claim him as an ancestor although genealogies do not verify the fact.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-04/#semi-permanent-migrations","title":"Semi-permanent Migrations","text":"<p>Barabaig rarely move into strange country on their own but rather in groups of families, gheida, which are usually found to be related either by agnatic or affinal kinship ties. It is not unusual to find several young men: who are married to sisters or who have the age group relationship of the raat, that is, they have killed together, emigrating together with their families.</p> <p>The Tatoga move for a variety of reasons. When asked they often reply that in their new-found land there is plenty of water and grazing. This is a supplementary reason; the chief reasons being overcrowding in their land of birth and/or the encroachment of an agricultural people. Sickness among children or cattle of the gheida is sufficient reason to leave one area and to settle elsewhere. To migrate is the indigenous soiution to these problems by the Tatoga. Family, lineage, and recently Government conflicts, provide incentives to move. This is the only traditional answer to the patriarch of a lineage segment if conflict occurs and a basic aspect of the segmentary principle in Tatoga society. The fact that the Tatoga have high mobility tempers the authority of the autocratic lineage heads. Another major cause of emigration is the news of relatives who have already emigrated and who have been successful in their newly found area. Others are encouraged to join them. Furthermore, a wealthy man collects clusters of younger sons of men who have few cattle. These young men, somnyant, plural somnyek, who have little to gain from their own pater adopt the wealthy leader and work for him in the hope that he will help them establish their own homesteads. The Tatoga also move to escape the multitude of rules and regulations of the modern Native Authority, such as road work, fly clearing, agricultural schemes, dam building, etc.</p> <p>Migration is an inherent cultural pattern of the Tatoga which can be seen from their wide and scattered distribution from Kenya to Manyoni, from Mbugwe to Lake Victoria. Today, however, a political consciousness is beginning to develop among the sub-tribes, no doubt due to the loss of freedom to migrate which has come about as a result of bovine disease control and other Veterinary Department rules. Another factor which militates against migration is the political development which has taken place among those people with whom the Tatoga groups live. These groups are able, by Native Authority ordinance, to control immigration to their tribal lands and because of this many Tatoga groups have been forced to settle more or less permanently in one area.</p> <p>Unfortunately, unlike their brother pastoralists, the Masai, the Tatoga have no vast area protected, preserved, and developed for them by Government.

These rules are enforced in each area by clan or community councils of elders, the gisjod. The Buradik, Bajut, Bianjit and Daragwajek are forced to reverse the practice because of physical factors. These sub-tribes graze the highland areas at the peak of the rainy season and then begin a slow migration into the Sibiti and Wembere plains as the waters recede.

It is not the mere fact of knowing the bird which is the attraction of ornithology, but of learning something of the bird\u2019s biological background. Moreover, a knowledge of the environment in which certain birds are to be found is an aid to their identification, or conversely when entering a certain type of country one knows which birds to look for, and those which are unlikely to be found there. A record of a bird not normally found in a certain habitat then becomes of considerable interest. For instance, in January 1943, Hugh F. Elliott and I were studying birds on the new Meserani dam in Masaiand and identified and collected a Terek Sandpiper (Terekia cinerea). That species, a Palaearctic migrant, had never before been noted in East Africa away from the coast, and was so unlike the birds we expected to see that it immediately drew our attention. As an observer\u2019s knowledge of the distribution of East African birds grows, he becomes more and more on the lookout for birds which have been recorded elsewhere in East Africa but which may not have been found in his own district. Here again a knowledge of the habitat of these birds is an aid to knowing where to look for them.</p> <p>The detailed background of this paper is largely limited to the Northern, Eastern, and Central Provinces with which I have been familiar for more than 18 years, but much is also drawn from the extensive and detailed studies made by R. E. Moreau (see bibliography) in the distribution of birds in Tanganyika Territory, especially that of forest birds. The principles underlying the study of ecology naturally have a world wide application and the bird-plant communities discussed can be found all over the Territory, although somewhat modified specifically according to their geographical position.</p> <p>Ecology may be defined as \u201cthe study of an organism as a whole in relation to its environment\u201d<sup>1</sup> The environment will be a synthesis of various factors, climate, soil, geography, altitude, all of which condition the composition of the vegetation, which in turn generally determines the incidence of the fauna. A study of plants shows that certain species will be found grouped together in \u201cassociations\u201d. The commonest plant in an association is known as a \u201cdominant\u2019 and gives its name to the association.</p> <p>A well known association in Tanganyika is the \u201cmiombo\u201d woodland in which trees of species of Brachystegia and Isoberlinia sp. are either individually or co-dominant. Another is the much closer bushy woodland of the Moshi area, where Combretum spp. are dominant. Plant associations do not, however, always cover extensive areas, and one may give place to another in a comparatively small area, or islands of one may be found in a large area of another. One may instance here the occurrence of patches of coastal thicket which are found in large areas of poor shrubby grassland on the coast, although some of these may be the remains of large areas which have been cleared in the course of time by the local cultivators.</p> <p>Superimposed on the plant communities are the insect, reptile, bird and animal communities, all inter-related through such factors as food requirements, climate, and altitude.</p> <p>Thus certain species of sandplover and sandpipers are found only on the seashore or lake edge, snipe whether in Europe or on migration in Africa are largely confined to marshy areas, because of their food requirements, the Ashy Starling, Vulturine Guinea-fowl, and Tit-babbler are characteristic of dry semi-arid areas while Johnston\u2019s Sunbird, the Mountain Chat and Golden-crowned Canary, are only found at higher altitudes. But how far each of the factors mentioned affects their distribution we do not know, nor whether still other factors are operative.</p> <p>In this paper the particular relationship between birds and their environment will be described mainly on a bird-plant community basis. but it should not be inferred that those two groups form isolated associations which can be analysed without reference to the other groups of the animal kingdom. For instance, while some birds are almost wholly fruit eating, large groups are insect eaters. Moreover birds themselves prey on other birds and are themselves preyed on by reptiles and various animals.</p> <p>The study of bird-ecology in Africa is a comparatively recent development. Chapin<sup>2</sup>, working in the Congo, studied bird distribution from an ecological viewpoint. He has been so ably followed by Moreau, in Tanganyika, whose studies of bird distribution in the Territory were at all times based on ecological criteria. But Moreau<sup>3</sup>, after discussing the several factors potentially affecting bird distribution, admits himself at a loss to give a rational explanation of it. He says, \u201cif I were called upon to declare my convictions in the matter, I could only say that temperature and humidity have a lot to do with it, but I cannot decide how; that vegetational formation, itself largely dependent on geo-morphology as well as on both temperature and humidity, is a prime indicator and prime determinate of the bird population in any particular spot, but that vegetational composition within the formation is far less important\u2019. Until much more is known of the climate of large areas of Africa, and the local variations in what Moreau terms the standard climate of a given habitat, and until more is known of the biology of certain birds typical of various habitats, one is compelled, in describing the distribution of the birds of the Territory, to relate them to the vegetative formations in which they are found.</p> <p>The following factors may all have bearing on the distribution of birds. (a) The presence or absence of suitable food and nesting sites. (b) Climatic factors, humidity, light, temperature, pressure, wind. (c) Vegetation. (d) The eco-climate (Moreau)<sup>4</sup>.</p> <p>The presence or absence of suitable nesting sites must obviously condition the distribution of some birds, such as the Giant Hornbills (Bycanistes cristatus and bucinator) which nest in holes in trees Trees large enough to contain suitable nest holes are practically only to be found in evergreen forest, which is the habitat of those species. But the lesser hornbills also nest in holes in trees, but do not enter evergreen forest for that purpose. Birds relying on tall upright grass for the support of their nests, such as the Bishop birds (Euplectes spp.) will be absent from short grass areas. Eut tne last species is noticeably absent from tall grass country immediately around Moshi, although the grasses appear ideal for its purpose. And consider the number of birds for which there are apparently adequate Se sites and materials in evergreen forest and woodland but which \u201ce to be found only in the one and not the other habitat. Moreau [^8] gave his opinion that of hardly one-tenth of the birds known to him in Usambara could it be said that the observed limits of distribution were conditioned by this factor. Nor, with the exception of water birds, does the food factor appear to play any large part in determining the distribution. Moreau<sup>3</sup> instances the fruit-eating Olive Pigeon (Columba arquatrix) which is common in the Usambara Highlands evergreen forest, but is almost unknown from the intermediate forest, although that is equally well supplied with fruit. On the other hand, at certain times of the year, there is considerable daily movement by some species from their true habitat, in searck of food elsewhere. The forest Hornbill (Bucanistes eristatus), and two forest starlings Onychognathus walleri and Stilbopsar kenricki all visit lowland areas when certain trees, particularly figs, are in fruit. The many insectivourous birds which are confined to certain habitats, although others appear equally well supplied with insect life. further support that opinion. But Moreau<sup>5</sup> has shown that the distribution of the Vulturine Fish-Eagle (Gypohierax angolensis) a common West African species\u2014is closely correlated with the occurrence of the Oil Palm, which appears to provide an important part of its food. This is well shown by the small colony of these birds at Sanje, in Ulanga District, where there are some forty-odd oil palms, which I believe is the only large group of this tree in the Kilosa, Morogoro or Ulanga Districts.</p> <p>Climatic factors, as mentioned above, do appear to have something to do with bird distribution, but vegetation is so closely correlated with climate that it is impossible. at the present stage, to decide which factors are dominant. Humidity, a resultant of rainfall and temyerature, is Ww Iss important in deciding the botany of the habitat. Both Chapin and Moreau agree that boundaries of bird communities are sharply defined by the boundaries of different vegetation formations, although Moreau<sup>3</sup> does not believe that this holds good for the changes in \u201chabit\u2019 \u2013 the different plant association within a formation, particularly within evergreen forest. Of 294 species of land birds from Usambara, Moreau<sup>3</sup> lists only 20 which are encountered both in evergreen forest and outside it. Moreover, in Usambara, where there are regenerating clearings in evergreen forest, no colonisation by forest birds occurs until \u201cthe small tree stage in the succession is reached, and then usually only by those species which inhabit the edges of evergreen forest. The same forest birds are, however, found in very dissimilar types of forest, whether humid or semi-humid, lowland or highland and in those forests maintain the same stratifications\u2014e.g. ground birds inhabit that stratum in all types of forest, birds of the canopy are always tree-top birds.</p> <p>The distribution of some of the genus Cisticola (Grass Warblers) apparently most markedly follows botanical formations. Cisticola cheniana is rarely found outside thorny woodland, or scattered bush and high grassland. Cisticola juncidis avoids scattered tree-grassland and shows marked preference for short grass plains whereas another small Cisticola C. brachyptera, appears to need a woodland, or at least a scattered tree-grassland habitat and is not found in the open plains.</p> <p>There is also a sharp difference between the birds of semi-arid bush-land or scattered-tree grassland, and those of the semi-humid long grass woodland, which will be referred to more fully later. It may be remarked here that the apparently austere habitat of semi-arid scatiered-tree grassland contains a greater number of bird species than any type of habitat known to me.</p> <p>Temperature itself may play some part in influencing breeding urges, and therefore influence the range of some birds. But as Moreau<sup>4</sup> has shown, in any given habitat there may be considerable differences in temperature near the ground, in dense grass or in tree tops, in the-depihs of forest and outside, all different from the standard temperature as measured on a screen. This will be referred to again under eco-climate.</p> <p>Moreau<sup>3</sup> found very definite altitudinal zoning of birds in the Usambara, most marked above 5,000. Of 88 forest forms only 11 appear to exist in any number throughout the Lowland, Intermediate and Highland forests.* The other 77 snow very defined range, 16 being confined to the Lowland forest. 21 species occur in the Lowland and Intermediate zones and 29 in the Intermediate and Highland zones only. In Usambara of the 200 spp. of non-forest birds only 16 do not occur in the lowland area, 7 of which are exclusively Highland and 9 confined to the Intermediate and Highland zones. The altitudinal limit is very well marked in some of these birds, particularly the Golden and Malachite Sunbirds (Drepanonlectes reichenowi and Nectarinia famosa), which never occur below 5,000\u2019, an observation which holds good for both on Meru, and in the case of the latter in the Uvidunda Mountains of Kilosa. The discontinuous range of some non-forest birds which occur both above and below the forest is also noted. But while the temperature changes with altitude, the difference between the mean maximum in Usambara for the hot and cold seasons is such that if birds show preferences for certain temperatures there would be well marked seasonal movements up and down the mountains. These do not take place and Moreau considers that it becomes unlikely that a direct reaction of birds to temperature is a general factor in controlling distribution locally.</p> <p>Light, pressure\u2014a function of altitude\u2014and wind are all factors which may play some part in controlling distribution, and light may be of some importance in relation to forest birds. Moreau<sup>4</sup> states that the light intensity at ground level in evergreen forest is 1/1,000 of that of the open air, and he suggests that birds which inhabit the gloom of the forest floor may be physically incapable of withstanding full sunlight. Outside, the forest biome light probably plays no part in distribution and Moreau considers it unlikely that pressure and wind play much part. Except within the forests most of Tanganyika is swept by strong winds towards the end of the dry season, to which all types of habitat, except the forest depths, are liable. These winds are more marked in open grass plains or scattered tree grasslands, but the botanical factor has already become operative and the differences in bird population are more probably due to botanical differences than to wind.</p> <p>One other factor should be mentioned before specific bird-plant communities are described. The climate within a patch of tall grass is very different from that on bare rocks nearby, and both differ from the standard climate of the surrounding open air. Those specialised climates, related to their environment, are referred to by Moreau and other workers as eco-climates. Thus all the members of a bird community in semi-arid thorn bush are not actually subjected to the same climate. Moreau<sup>4</sup> instances the case of a lark working the ground by day, which is exposed to a higher air temperature than a Kappoc-tit on a twig 6\u2019 above, a difference which on data from temperate regions, is equivalent to the difference involved in more than 5,000\u2019 in altitude. Generally the eco-climates within dense herbage or in woodland and near the ground are more extreme than the standard, whereas in forest under a canopy the daily maxima are generally lower than the standard climate. It is only reasonable to suppose that, when such eco-climatic differences can occur in adjacent habitats, eco-climate must play some part in a bird\u2019s choice of habitat.</p> <p>As will be appreciated from the preceding paragraphs, too little is known of the force of each factor in deciding a bird\u2019s choice of habitat. so that in the present state of knowledge of bird distribution one is forced to use, almost entirely, the vegetational factor to provide the compartments for our bird associations. Altitude is also of some importance, forming, as it were, first floor and attic rooms in the distribution, and is chiefly noticeable about 4,500\u2019. In using the term \u201ccompartments\u201d and \u201crooms\u201d, I do not wish it to be thought that the bird-vegetation associations are sharply demarcated; several species are common to many vegetational formations, and are to be found at widely different altitudes. The terms do, however, give the broad impression of the intentions of this paper, to show briefly the most important birds to be found in the chief vegetational formations of a large part of the Territory.</p> <p>In order to keep the description of the habitats as simple and easily recognisable as possible, I may have outraged some botanical opinion by broadly lumping habitats of rather different dominant species. It has also led to artificial grouping of some birds from similar types of habitat from north, east and south which would not be found together, although the majority occur in those habitats throughout the greater part of the Territory.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-05/#bibliography","title":"BIBLIOGRAPHY","text":"<p>* In Usambara Moreau recognises Lowland evergreen forest with an upper limit of 2,500\u2019; Intermediate from 2,500'\u20144,500' and Highland above 4,500\u2019.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-05/#use-of-the-keys","title":"Use of the Keys.","text":"<p>I have tried to pick out the features which strike one in the field, such as a bright colour, or noticeable white mark or streaking.

BIRDS OF THE SEASHORE.","text":"<p>Where the coast lies open to the Indian Ocean the receding tide generally leaves great areas of mud and sand-flats which are particularly attractive to the many migrant sandplovers and sandpipers from the Northern hemisphere. African forms of those families also occur. These are commonly known as waders and have characteristically long legs in relation to their general size. In creeks and inlets muddier conditions generally prevail, a smaller area is uncovered by the tide, and mangroves make their appearance. At high tide, when there is only a narrow strip of dry sand between the water and the first vegetation, very few waders are to be seen on the shore. As the tide rises flocks fly to larger, undisturbed areas of the beach, or inland a short distance to low-lying marshy land. Salt pans are a favourite haunt at high tide.</p> <p>Members of the sandpiper family feed on a mixed diet including insects, small mollusca and crustacea, fish fry and occasionally vegetable matter, and are commonly seen dibbing and probing the sand with their long bills. Many of these are not restricted to the seashore but are found on lake shores and along large rivers with suitable open beaches. There is a certain amount of differentiation in the area chosen for feeding, some species such as the Little Stint, Sanderling and Ringed Plover keeping very near the water\u2019s edge, while the White-fronted and Kittlitz Sand-plovers, the Three-ringed Plover and others seem to prefer the mudflats uncovered by the tide. The larger waders such as the Curlews, Oystercatchers and Whimbrels are more usually seen away from the water\u2019s edge, but at very low tides are sometimes found in the water. A species which is a great paddler, as well as being a somewhat uncommon, odd-looking bird, is the Crab-Plover, which may be seen in small flocks opposite the golf course at Dar es Salaam and on the beaches at Mjimwema. This long-legged species happily paddles in fairly calm water well over its \u2018knees\u2019.</p> <p>At low tide the waders are frequently joined by resting terns, gulls and sometimes by berons and egrets, although most of the last are more particularly birds of riverine, lake and swamp habitats. Kingfishers, particularly the Pied Kingfisher, fish from the posts of fish-traps at high tide, but are more particularly birds of the inlets and estuaries.</p> <p>Large reefs, exposed at low tide, both inshore and more distant, attract a great variety of birds. This is the favourite hunting ground for most of the waders, which scatter themselves all over the pool-studded surface. Herons and egrets fish in the pools, while the Pied Kingfisher hovers over the larger ones. Terns rest near the water\u2019s edge, occasionally springing into the air to give one of their masterly exhibitons of massed, unified flight, with sudden coordinated swings and swoops.</p> <p>In harbours the most noticeable birds are kites and gulls which spend their time scavenging round ships. I have yet to see the Fishing Owl although it has been recorded from further north.</p> <p>The mangrove areas are not particularly rich in bird life except for the Mangrove Kingfisher, and sometimes attracting herons, egrets and cormorants. Bee-eaters may sometimes hawk insects from the mangroves, but they are ubiquitous and cannot be considered a typical component of the shore community. Where a few trees occur, and then only near an estuary, the uncommon Osprey may sometimes be found, as well as the resident Fish Eagle.</p> <p>The following list of birds has been recorded from the Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Malindi beaches.

Identification of the Pelican, Herons and Egrets, Fish Eagle, Osprey and Kite, Gulls, Crab-plover and Kingfishers should present little difficulty. The Sandpipers and Sand-Plovers are another matter and a Satisfactory field key is almost an impossibility. Relative sizes are an important aid in identifying these birds and that is impossible to convey adequately by the words larger and smaller. The following field notes may help a little in deciding the bird\u2019s identity.</p> <p>Hemprich\u2019s Gull is the only really common gull of the coast, and all the gulls seen in the harbours are almost certain to be this species. The Black-backed is much more rarely seen, although a small flock used to congregate at low tide on the sandspit at the mouth of the Msimbazi river near Selander Bridge, Dar es Salaam.</p> <p>The Terns are almost invariably seen in flocks, sometimes in harbours, more generally in the open sea, and at lew tide congregated on reefs. Their pale grey plumage, forked tails and long bills are characteristic. The species are not easy to distinguish without considerable familiarity with them. To confuse identification other species not listed may be present on rare occasions. In breeding plumage those known on the East African coast have black forehead, crown and nape with the exception of the Crested Tern, which has a white forehead.</p> <p>The sand-plovers and sandpipers, Stint, Sanderling and Turnstone are mostly comparatively small birds, and many are seen chiefly in flocks. Long legs in relation to body size and short and long bills in relation to head size are important diagnostic cnaracters. Bill and feet colour is not much aid to identification with cne cr two exceptions.</p> <p>The Ringed and Three-ringed Sand-Plovers are most easily known and the yellow bill and orange legs of the first are distinct from the red bill and yellow legs of the second. These two birds are generally seen in ones and twos, as is the very distinctive Turnstone, with its mottled dark and light brown and white upperparts and black-brown bar across the chest. It is a bird which gives the impression of single-minded concentration on the job in hand when seen searching for food on the landward edge of a reef at low tide. Its black bill distinguishes it from the other \u2018banded\u2019 plovers.</p> <p>The Mongolian Sand Dotterel, Kittlitz and White-fronted Sand-Plover are difficult to identify. They are sometimes seen in small parties, but more frequently in ones and twos. They all have a distinct white forehead, and Kittlitz Sand-Plover is more easily distinguished with its black edge to the white collar on the back of the neck. The Mongolian Sand Dotterel gives the appearance of standing higher on its legs; it does not have the white nuchal collar of the other two.</p> <p>Of the Sandpiper family perhaps the Sanderling is most readily identified because of its pale plumage and the black at the point of shoulder of the wing. Sanderlings are generally seen in close flocks standing at the water\u2019s edge. Terek\u2019s Sandpiper is a rare visitor to Dar es Salaam but its upceurved bill and yellow feet are good diagnostic characters. A very common shorebird in small parties and singly is the Curlew Sandpiper, of rather insignificant appearance, but which can be easily told with a good sight of the bill, which is distinctly downcurved at the tip.</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-05/#field-key","title":"FIELD KEY","text":""},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-05/#i-mainly-white-plumage","title":"I.

A. Fosbrooke.","text":"<p>Tanganyika is rich in archaeological remains and those already found in the small portion of the Territory which has been subjected to extensive archaeological investigation indicate that many more sites of great scientific value still await discovery. There is unfortunately as yet no compre- hensive volume to which the enquirer can be referred comparable with publications dealing with adjacent territories, such as Dr. Leakey\u2019s \u201cStone Age Cultures of Kenya,\u201d Dr. Clark\u2019s \u201cStone Age Cultures of Northern Rhodesia,\u201d or Rev. Neville Jones\u2019 \u2018Prehistory of Southern Rhodesia.\u201d This paper will therefore attempt to summarize very briefly the present state of our knowledge of the known relics of Tanganyika\u2019s past.</p> <p>For the purpose of these notes man\u2019s past can be broadly divided into three periods, the prehistoric, the protohistoric and the historic. By the first, the prehistoric, we mean that period concerning which there are no written or oral records available, by the protohistoric that period of which oral or traditional record is available, but nothing in writing, and by historic that period covered by the written record. It will of course be obvious from what follows that these broad divisions must to some extent overlap. At one and the same time there are written records available concerning events on the coast known to the Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries, traditions preserved during this period amongst some up-country tribes who have enjoyed some stability of culture for a considerable period, and nothing but the stone implements of other folk now lost who were co-existing at \u2018the same time with a culture still at the stone age level.</p> <p>Prehistoric man has left evidence of his presence in three forms; his stone implements, his paintings and engravings on rock and his own skeletal remains. Tanganyika is fortunate in being able to provide at Olduvai 3 classic series of implements, showing the development of the tools used by Early Stone Age man from a locally chipped pebble to a well-formed hand axe. <sup>1</sup></p> <p>The Early Stone Age was the time before man had yet discovered how to produce a cutting edge from flints, obsidian or other such hard materials. It is a sobering thought, and one which may help to get today\u2019s problems into perspective, that this period of evolution occupied so many millenia that the Serengeti Plains were flooded to form a lake, desiccated into steppeland with typical steppe fauna, were reflooded, and again dried out. This was before that area had assumed the topography familiar today caused by rifting and tectonic activity.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>The Middle Stone Age in Africa was that period of man\u2019s development during which his implements were of a smaller type, formed by a different technique and of different material. There were blades with sharp cutting edges, points and scrapers formed of such materials as were available, flint in Europe, hard stone such as agate, quartzite and quartz in East Africa generally, and, in the volcanic areas, that striking material, obsidian, which presents the appearance of black glass. Many such artifacts are found in the upper strata at Olduvai, in the neighbouring rock shelter of Apis (Nasera) Rock and in the form of surface finds throughout Northern Tanganyika.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>The Late Stone Age is characterized not only by the implements of the Middle Stone Age described above. but also by stone bowls, occasional volished axes, a certain amount of crude pottery and beads made of chips of ostrich shell and other such material drilled through the middle. It is probable that certain tribes of Tanganyika were living at a Late Stone Age cultural level till very recently, in particular the Hadzapi or Tindiga recently described in Tanganyika Notes and Records.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>The second form in which early man left his mark was that of rock paintings and engravings, and Tanganyika is particularly rich in the former. The Kondoa district is the main centre where over 100 painted sites are known. Every new visit by trained observers produces many more finds and it is obvious that this store of prehistoric art is only now begin viing to be tapped.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>As distinct from the early art of Europe where pre-historic paintings usually occurred in caves, those of Tanganyika are found on the surface of rock shelters. These may be formed by the underside of boulders or groups of boulders in the form of kopjes or by slabs of rock protruding at an angle from the ground, or again by undercutting at the base of cliffs or escarpments. According to the degree of overhang, so varies the degree of protection from the elements. This means that no sealed caves comparable to those in Europe have been found to enable the paintings to be dated with any certainty, but when the world-famed expert M. l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Breuil visited Tanganyika on the occasion of the Pan-African Congress on Pre-history in 1948, he pronounced the earliest paintings comparable in age with the oldest in Europe and South Africa.</p> <p>The style of these paintings varies from naturalistic reproductions of game animals to fantastic reproductions of the human form. The main characteristics of these latter are the elongated nature of the body, the head-dresses, masks or hair styles which frequently obscure the shape of the head, and the arm and leg ornaments such as can be observed in, for instance, some dancing scenes. Crudely drawn animals are sometimes mistaken by the uninitiated for representations of extinct species, but expert examination has invariably revealed these to be examples of the desraded art forms practised by the immediate predecessors of the present- day inhabitants during, probably, the last two or three centuries.</p> <p>Another manifestation of this so-called \u201cmodern white\u201d technique is found in the form of geometric design\u2014circles, squares with dots, crosses, and a multiplicity of other formalized designs. No adequate explanation has yet been put forward of the meaning of these: nor are the artists known with any certainly, but as a working hypothesis it can be assumed that the early styles of naturalistic animals and formalized design were the work of Stone Age artists, whilst the \u201cmodern whites\u201d are those of the immigrant Rantu of recent centuries. It is hoped that the excavations which commenced in the 1951 season in some of the Kondoa shelters and which will proceed year by year will finally present us with a solution to this problem.</p> <p>One of the highest manifestations of prehistoric art in South Africa is to be found in the form of engravings in rock, but of these very few examples are known in Tanganyika. Some instances of crudely hammered out animal forms of infantile conception are known but only one example of anything moderately ancient has come to light, in the form of animal figures very reminiscent of the rock engravings of the Sahara and the Upper Nile area.</p> <p>The third form in which man leaves traces of his past is that of his skeletal remains. So far few of these have come to light in Tanganyika, but those which have, have achieved considerable publicity in scientific circles. For many years controversy raged around the fossil cranium of a man found by Professor Reck in the Olduvai Gorge in 1918. It was at first thought that here we might have a representative of the people responsible for the hand axe culture so richly represented at this site, but subsequent examination of the position by numerous experts has led to the conclusion that Olduvai man is of Middle and not Early Stone Age origin.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>.</p> <p>There is every reason to believe that Olduvai man was of the same species as that which inhabits the world today, i.e., Homo sapiens, but his neighbour, Eyassi man, who was found by Dr. Kohl Larsen at the north end of Lake Eyassi in 1936, belongs to a separate species, Paieanthropus njarasensis. <sup>6</sup> <sup>7</sup>. Again discovery of these remains was accompanied by fantastic claims concerning their age, but the latest position is perhaps best summarized by Wells, (1950) in the following quotation <sup>8</sup>:\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWeidenreich (1943) has suggested that the fragmentary skull from Lake Eyassi in Tanganyika, formerly regarded as very primitive in character and compared with the Pekin and Java fossil men, is in reality intimately related to the Broken Hill skull. Such a relationship appears highly probable; it is indeed possible that the Broken Hill and Eyassi skulls belong essentially to the same type, but the Eyassi remains are too imperfect for the exact degree of relationship to be established. It is noteworthy that Leakey (1946) considers the Eyassi skull to be associated with a Levalloisian culture roughly equivalent to the early stages of the Middle Stone Age in Northern Rhodesia.\u201d</p> <p>Thus of the Old Stone Age no representative has as yet come to light in Tanganyika. Of Middle Stone Age man we have two examples, one of human and one of allied species. Of Late Stone Age man skeletons have been found in the grave cairns of Ngorongoro, but these still await description in scientific literature. Numerous other burial cairns do occur throughout Northern Tanganyika but from only one of these has the skeleton been scientifically examined <sup>9</sup><sup>10</sup> and here there were no artifacts to enable an association to be made between this man and his culture.</p> <p>So much, then, for the prehistoric remains, mostly many thousands of years old, of which naturally enough no tradition is extant. In the protohistoric sphere dealt with hereunder, some of the traditions are clear and credible, others mere vestiges from the dawn of tribal history which cannot be accepted without corroborative evidence. In the last few centuries many races and tribes have moved across the East African stage, leaving only the vaguest of traces of their passage. Some of these are in the form of tribal remnants still existing amongst the better-known tribes of Tanganyika. Other traces of these early peoples are to be found in the form of house sites, earthworks and other such remains, Whilst Tanganyika can offer nothing comparable with Zimbabwe or Khami, there exists at Engaruka at the base of the Rift wall between Lakes Natron and Manyara the remains of a large town, which Dr. Leakey esti- mated must have contained a population of between 30 and 40 thousand <sup>11</sup>. The remains to be seen today consist of the crumbiing stone walls of circular huts, cairns thought to be burial cairns hut having so far vielded no skeletal remains, and stone terraces and water courses. Some of these protohistoriec inhabitants must have been well versed in the improvement and conservation of water supplies. In central Masailand there is a series of wells driven through crystalline limestone to a depth of up to 60 ft. Those illustrated in a recent number of Tanganyika Notes and Records<sup>12</sup> have jost all resemblance to their original form, having been converted into wide-mouthed apertures in the form of inverted truncated cones by the unskilled excavations of Chaga tribesmen employed by the Masai to \u201cimprove\u201d these sources of water. But at Naberera, Makami and Ndedo subsequent excavation has been less radical, so the original form of the wells can be seen. The shaft is consistently narrow\u2014only about 2\u2019 6\u201d in diameter\u2014and some have argued from this that the makers of these wells must either have been very small people or have possessed some particular technique of well sinking. But this theory cannot be substantiated as the air shafts of the underground bolt holes referred to later are of even smaller diameter and yet we have evidence that they were dug by the tribes at present in the area who are neither small nor particularly skilled excavators.</p> <p>Throughout and beyond Masailand there are to be found numerous earthworks in the form of dams. About three miles to the west of Ngorongoro camp there is a series of three dams in a drainage line coming from Oldeani mountain. The conservers of this water must have found that the lowest dam frequently failed to fill, possibly as the country desiccated in the course of one of the recent climatic fluctuations known to have occurred in East Africa. In consequence they cut a diversion ditch from a neighbouring water course to fill the bottom dam. The road from Ngorongoro camp to the Serengeti now passes over the middle dam and through the diversion cut. In central Masailand and as far south as the area around Kongwa, which was cleared of bush for the Groundnut Scheme, depressions are to be found, which present every appearance of being artificially created to conserve surface water, but no excavations have been carried out, nor have any of the tools or weapons of the people concerned been found to suggest who they might have been. There is however every reason to believe that they were a pastoral people practising a system of transhumance, i.e. using the grazing and rainwater on the plains during the rainy season and falling back on permanent water supplies in rivers and the wells referred to above in the dry season. So here again is evidence of moderately recent climatic change, for no one could have herded cattle in the thick deciduous thicket which was cleared in the course of the Groundnut Scheme: it must have been much more open grassland when these rain ponds were excavated.</p> <p>Another type of protohistoric remains more accessible to the visitor is to be found in the Moshi and Pare districts <sup>13</sup> &amp; <sup>14</sup>. These consist of elaborate underground earthworks in the form of passages and chambers wherein were hidden cattle and womenfolk in the time of tribal warfare. Contrary to popular belief it was not so much the pastoral Masai who were the cause of these elaborate anti-raid precautions as the neighbouring Bantu tribes, who seem to have spent much of their time and energy in raiding neighbours. A good example of such remains is to be seen within a few jundreds yards of the two hotels at Marangu, Moshi district. In this neigh- bourhood also can be seen some interesting examples of the engraved rocks which are associated with the initiation ceremonies which the present inhabitants of the area, the Chaga, practised up to the beginning of this century.<sup>15</sup>:</p> <p>Another type of protohistoric remains, namely, the stone-walled fort, is also exemplified in this area. These works were of dry-stone masonry. The art of creating lime mortar does not seem to have penetrated inland, though it had been practised on the coast for many centuries. Such forts seem to have been a later development in the practice of tribal warfare, and their form is doubtless due to Arab influence spread with the slave trade through much of Tanganyika. The Northern area was, however, icrtunate in suffering a minimum of hardship from this scourge.</p> <p>Further stonework in the form of terraces is to be found in the Hehe area.<sup>16</sup>.</p> <p>Finally, one particular type of rock painting which is termed the \u201cmodern white\u201d is thought to be only two or three centuries old and to have been the work of the tribes who were the immediate predecessors of the present inhabitants of the area concerned. <sup>5</sup> &amp; <sup>17</sup>. This phase of prehistoric art is largely symbolic and where the representation of animals is attempted is crude in the extreme.</p> <p>As explained above, the creation of many of these protohistoric remains must have been contemporary with or subsequent to events concerning which written records exist, so bringing them into the historic category. Readers of Tanganyika Notes and Records are particularly fortunate in having so indefatigable a contributor as Sir John Gray, whose articles (18-23) shed such light on the history of the East African Coast. Many more tangible remains of this history exist than of the tribal ebb and flow of the hinterland. The abandoned city of Gedi and the massive pile of Fort Jesus at Mombasa, both in Kenya, are rivalled by the equally impressive but less publicized remains in Tanganyika. Numerous examples of these latter have however been described in Tanganyika Notes and Records <sup>14</sup>-<sup>18</sup>, and more recently in a well-illustrated article in the East African Annual <sup>19</sup>. In a relatively undeveloped country such as Tanganyika, many relics of prehistoric, protohistoric and historic times still doubtless await discovery, whilst those that are known cannot be protected with the meticuluous care which is devoted to similar remains in richer and more advanced countries. So the assistance of the public is all the more necessary in preserving our heritage from the past.</p> <p>Such assistance can be given in two ways, firstly by reporting any such discoveries to the Secretariat or the nearest District Office. When possible such reports will be investigated by an expert, and if the site is deemed worthy it will be \u201cgazetted\u201d and so given protection under the Monuments Preservation Ordinance, 1937. Thereafter excavation, tampering with, or removing parts of such relics is forbidden except under licence. But by the very nature of this process there is bound to be a hiatus between the discovery of a valuable site and its protection.</p> <p>So the second way in which the public can assist is by exercising restraint: by refraining from chipping or drawing round newly discovered rock paintings, from digging up and removing bones or stone implements from freshly revealed sites or from removing\u2014a heinous but common crime\u2014built-in bowls from ruined mosques and tombs. The satisfaction of having discovered, and preserved for posterity, some valuable relic is much greater than that to be gained from the surreptitious removal of souvenirs.</p> <p>REFERENCES</p>"},{"location":"volumes/vol-01/issue-01/article-06/#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>View Original PDF</p> <ol> <li> <p>Leakey, L.S.B.
